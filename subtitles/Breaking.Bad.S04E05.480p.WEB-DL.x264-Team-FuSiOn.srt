1
00:00:03,744 --> 00:00:05,472
Say you understand.

2
00:00:05,504 --> 00:00:07,200
Do you understand?

3
00:00:07,232 --> 00:00:09,504
Tell me you understand, Saul!

4
00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:12,736
Every dollar--

5
00:00:12,768 --> 00:00:14,656
If you don't hear from me
in 24 hours--

6
00:00:14,688 --> 00:00:16,736
No, no. Saul. Saul, shut up.

7
00:00:16,768 --> 00:00:19,072
Shut up and listen to me.

8
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,048
I want you to give her
every last dollar.

9
00:00:22,112 --> 00:00:24,544
I don't care if you have
to stuff it in trash bags.

10
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,920
Just make sure
she gets everything.

11
00:00:25,952 --> 00:00:28,192
All right?
Just make it happen!

12
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:49,216
<i>Hi.
You've reached the White family.</i>

13
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:50,688
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,480
Uh...

15
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:55,104
Hey. It's me.

16
00:00:55,136 --> 00:00:56,672
Um...

17
00:00:56,704 --> 00:00:58,656
I-- I...

18
00:00:58,688 --> 00:00:59,904
I just wanted to say

19
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:01,824
that I was thinking about you

20
00:01:01,856 --> 00:01:04,032
and the kids, and, uh...

21
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,328
I love you.

23
00:02:44,576 --> 00:02:46,112
Hello. Would you like to try

24
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,480
our Breakfast Chicken
Chalupa Combo Meal?

25
00:02:48,512 --> 00:02:49,600
Gus Fring.

26
00:02:49,632 --> 00:02:51,328
Excuse me?

27
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,240
Gustavo Fring, your boss, now.

28
00:02:54,272 --> 00:02:55,552
Please.

29
00:02:55,584 --> 00:02:56,800
Mr. Fring
isn't here right now.

30
00:02:56,832 --> 00:02:58,496
- Is there something I'm able--
- He's here.

31
00:02:58,528 --> 00:03:01,056
His car's parked out front.
He's here.

32
00:03:01,088 --> 00:03:02,752
He was here.
Mr. Fring was--

33
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,032
You just go in the back

34
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,824
and you tell him
it's Walter White.

35
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,880
Understand?

36
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:10,784
He'll know what it's about.

37
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,712
I'll wait.

38
00:05:31,744 --> 00:05:33,056
Hello.

39
00:05:33,088 --> 00:05:35,904
<i>Walter, what
exactly are you doing?</i>

40
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:39,040
Where's Jesse?

41
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,344
<i>Jesse's with me.
He's fine.</i>

42
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:43,840
Do you expect me
to just believe that?

43
00:05:43,872 --> 00:05:45,888
<i>I'm crossing my heart, Walter.</i>

44
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,552
Where is he?

45
00:05:47,584 --> 00:05:49,504
<i>Hold on.</i>

46
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:51,000
<i>Yo.</i>

47
00:05:52,032 --> 00:05:53,056
Jesse?

48
00:05:53,088 --> 00:05:54,272
<i>Yeah. What's up?</i>

49
00:05:54,304 --> 00:05:57,344
Jesse, w-where are you?

50
00:05:57,376 --> 00:05:58,400
<i>With Mike.</i>

51
00:05:58,432 --> 00:06:00,672
I know you're with Mike.

52
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:02,336
Are-- Are you all right?

53
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:03,744
Does he have a gun on you?

54
00:06:05,216 --> 00:06:06,496
No.

55
00:06:06,528 --> 00:06:09,152
<i>Well, what's going on, then?</i>

56
00:06:09,184 --> 00:06:11,488
We're driving.

57
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,512
<i>Driving?</i>

58
00:06:12,544 --> 00:06:14,912
Driving where?

59
00:06:15,904 --> 00:06:17,088
I don't know.

60
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,200
Uh, north.

61
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:24,800
W-W-- Why is he driving you?

62
00:06:24,832 --> 00:06:25,888
<i>Where is he going?</i>

63
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,616
Beats me.

64
00:06:27,648 --> 00:06:29,536
I-- I don't-- I--

65
00:06:29,568 --> 00:06:30,816
Put Mike back on.

66
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,872
Hello again.

67
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:39,264
Mike, tell me now
exactly what is going on.

68
00:06:39,296 --> 00:06:41,792
Jesse's with me today,
so what you need to do

69
00:06:41,824 --> 00:06:44,448
is to go back to your lab
and get on with the cook.

70
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,944
You're gonna have to muddle through
this one without him, okay?

71
00:06:46,976 --> 00:06:48,576
<i>That's what's going on.</i>

72
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,016
But it doesn't--

73
00:06:50,048 --> 00:06:51,136
<i>Goodbye, Walter.</i>

74
00:06:51,168 --> 00:06:52,320
Mike--

75
00:07:17,568 --> 00:07:19,008
Sir--

76
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,120
Excuse me. Sir.

77
00:07:21,152 --> 00:07:22,592
You're not allowed back there.

78
00:07:22,624 --> 00:07:23,648
Excuse me, sir.

79
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:27,872
As I said, sir,
Mr. Fring is not here.

80
00:07:27,904 --> 00:07:29,632
This area's for employees only,

81
00:07:29,664 --> 00:07:31,648
and I have to ask
that you leave immediately.

82
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,616
What you told Mr. White,
that's...

83
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,872
that's just bullshit, right?

84
00:08:20,832 --> 00:08:25,632
You, uh, you figure on just
leaving me in some ditch?

85
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,752
What do you care?

86
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,024
I don't.

87
00:08:35,232 --> 00:08:37,920
But I'll tell you now,
you better shoot straight,

88
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:39,744
old man,

89
00:08:39,776 --> 00:08:41,344
or I'll slice off
your other ear

90
00:08:41,376 --> 00:08:43,360
before this is over.

91
00:10:42,944 --> 00:10:44,320
Ahem.

92
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:09,536
You coming?

93
00:12:11,008 --> 00:12:13,120
We got to do this
six more times today,

94
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:15,232
with a lot of miles in between.

95
00:12:15,264 --> 00:12:18,144
I'd like to finish before dark.

96
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,864
This freaking guy,
I tell you what.

97
00:13:00,928 --> 00:13:02,976
It's like Scarface had sex

98
00:13:03,008 --> 00:13:04,480
with Mister Rogers
or something.

99
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:07,264
Who does this, you know?

100
00:13:07,296 --> 00:13:08,672
Your boy Heisenberg.

101
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,016
Thought we had him already.

102
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:12,064
Yeah. Keep dreaming.

103
00:13:12,096 --> 00:13:13,088
Yeah, no.

104
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,464
Getz busted him
a few months back.

105
00:13:14,496 --> 00:13:16,672
Yeah, well, no offense

106
00:13:16,704 --> 00:13:18,368
to Detective
Doogie Howser there,

107
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,304
but all he caught
was a dipshit lifer

108
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:24,192
by the name
of Jimmy In-N-Out.

109
00:13:24,224 --> 00:13:27,040
This one--
He's your Heisenberg?

110
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,344
Yeah, I believe he is.

111
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:30,752
So what are you thinking?

112
00:13:30,784 --> 00:13:32,768
Rival drug gang
taking out the mastermind?

113
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,032
Any names I should check out?

114
00:13:36,096 --> 00:13:37,600
I wish I could help you there.

115
00:13:37,664 --> 00:13:40,096
Only two people I know
connected with the blue stuff.

116
00:13:40,128 --> 00:13:44,096
Uh, one is a beanie-wearing
jizz stain

117
00:13:44,128 --> 00:13:45,824
by the name
of Brandon Mayhew--

118
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:47,456
Street name, uh, Badger.

119
00:13:47,488 --> 00:13:50,240
Definitely another player.

120
00:13:50,272 --> 00:13:55,104
The other one
is, uh, Jesse Pinkman.

121
00:13:56,896 --> 00:13:58,144
He and I have a history.

122
00:13:58,176 --> 00:14:00,768
Yeah.

123
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,976
You see Pinkman as a shooter?

124
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:05,760
That would surprise me.

125
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:08,064
Well, we got a composite

126
00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:10,048
of a person of interest.

127
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,896
It's a guy the neighbors saw

128
00:14:12,928 --> 00:14:15,968
at Boetticher's place
right after the shooting.

129
00:14:17,536 --> 00:14:20,480
Eh...sorry.

130
00:14:20,512 --> 00:14:22,176
No, hang on to it,
just in case.

131
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,704
Then we got a couple of
prints we're hoping to I.D.

132
00:14:24,736 --> 00:14:26,176
If I get any kind of hit,

133
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,968
I'll keep you
in the loop on that.

134
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,008
You know, uh, Tim,

135
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,888
look, I appreciate
what you're doing, really--

136
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,776
Uh, you know, keeping me
involved and all,

137
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,432
but, uh, you know,

138
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:43,776
finding this guy Heisenberg
dead like this...

139
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:47,744
I have to say, it, uh...

140
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:49,664
kind of feels like closure
to me, you know?

141
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:53,728
Hank, you really are
a big help here.

142
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,520
No, I know.
I get it, really.

143
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:57,792
But I'm done.

144
00:15:53,376 --> 00:15:54,848
Oh, no.

145
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:04,160
You don't need to do that.

146
00:16:05,504 --> 00:16:07,000
This is why I'm out here,
right?

147
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:10,080
To be, like, your backup?

148
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,864
Uh-huh.

149
00:16:12,896 --> 00:16:16,576
So if I'm out here
in a guard-type capacity

150
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:17,696
to watch over the money,

151
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:21,184
that means I need, like,
a gun, right?

152
00:16:21,216 --> 00:16:22,272
Nope.

153
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,576
I mean, isn't that,
like, completely idiotic

154
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:42,176
for me to be out here
without a gun?

155
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,968
I mean, you haven't said dick

156
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,344
about what I'm supposed
to be doing here,

157
00:16:45,376 --> 00:16:46,944
and I'm supposed
to do it without a gun?

158
00:16:46,976 --> 00:16:49,568
How does that even make sense?

159
00:16:51,776 --> 00:16:52,800
What?

160
00:16:52,864 --> 00:16:54,400
I can smoke, right?

161
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:56,832
Not a chance.

162
00:17:39,616 --> 00:17:40,672
Uhh...

163
00:17:44,224 --> 00:17:46,688
Buh-buh-buh-buh-
buh-buh-buh-buh.

164
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:03,840
♪ Fallacies♪

165
00:18:03,872 --> 00:18:05,504
♪ Fallacies♪

166
00:18:05,536 --> 00:18:08,160
♪ One for you and two for me♪

167
00:18:20,128 --> 00:18:21,536
Uhh.

168
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:25,664
It's finally hitting me
what the-- The plan is here.

169
00:18:25,696 --> 00:18:28,320
It's to bore me to death, so...

170
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,896
mission accomplished
because it's totally working.

171
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:35,168
Great job.

172
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,184
You know, I really do
get what's going on

173
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:45,024
with all the dead drops
and bags of cash.

174
00:18:47,008 --> 00:18:49,184
I mean, my boys
had the exact same system

175
00:18:49,216 --> 00:18:51,264
when I was running things.

176
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,896
My crew.

177
00:18:54,144 --> 00:18:56,256
Nowhere near the same cheese
you guys are slinging,

178
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,336
but same theory--

179
00:18:58,368 --> 00:19:02,432
To maintain separation
between dealer and supplier,

180
00:19:02,496 --> 00:19:04,448
reduce risk,

181
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,464
et cetera.

182
00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:09,632
Look, don't you think
it would be good

183
00:19:09,664 --> 00:19:13,536
if there was some back and
forth communication here?

184
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:15,008
You got me riding shotgun

185
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,768
to every dark anal recess
of this state.

186
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,232
Be nice if you
clued me in a little.

187
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:24,800
I mean, I'm here
to do a job, right?

188
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:28,416
And, I mean, yo,
like, if I'm the guy,

189
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:31,744
then you should just tell me
what the hell's up.

190
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,504
What?

191
00:19:37,536 --> 00:19:39,552
You are not the guy.

192
00:19:39,584 --> 00:19:41,408
You're not capable
of being the guy.

193
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,168
I had a guy, but now I don't.

194
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,920
You are not the guy.

195
00:19:47,424 --> 00:19:49,056
Then what the hell
am I doing here?

196
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:51,648
I don't know.
It's not my call.

197
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,928
I just do what I'm told,

198
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,848
and now you're gonna
do what you're told,

199
00:19:54,912 --> 00:19:57,472
which is to sit here, shut up,

200
00:19:57,504 --> 00:20:00,160
and stay in the car
till we finish our pickups.

201
00:20:00,192 --> 00:20:01,536
You got it?

202
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:48,640
Oh.

203
00:21:55,136 --> 00:21:57,088
We having second thoughts?

204
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,720
Every hour of every day.

205
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:00,768
Let me tell you,

206
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,464
that is perfectly normal.

207
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,832
But your expectations
are realistic.

208
00:22:04,864 --> 00:22:06,944
You have a good,
solid business plan.

209
00:22:06,976 --> 00:22:08,960
I'm feeling very confident.

210
00:22:08,992 --> 00:22:11,584
You have an excellent shot
at making this work.

211
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,680
Walt.

212
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,040
Hmm.

213
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:20,096
We good?

214
00:22:22,048 --> 00:22:23,104
Yeah.

215
00:22:28,064 --> 00:22:29,280
All right.

216
00:22:38,912 --> 00:22:42,752
Well, my congratulations
to the both of you.

217
00:22:42,816 --> 00:22:44,800
Thank you very much, Alan.

218
00:22:44,832 --> 00:22:46,688
It is my pleasure.

219
00:22:48,352 --> 00:22:49,408
Ah.

220
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,192
Mr. White.

221
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,144
Best of luck.

222
00:22:54,176 --> 00:22:55,168
Thank you.

223
00:22:56,544 --> 00:22:59,008
I'm bringing my car over
first thing next week

224
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,192
for a wash and wax.

225
00:23:00,224 --> 00:23:01,536
Oh, well, we'll
be looking for you.

226
00:23:01,568 --> 00:23:03,296
I'll be there.

227
00:23:03,328 --> 00:23:04,288
Thank you again.

228
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,280
You're welcome.

229
00:23:05,312 --> 00:23:06,304
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

230
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,144
Wow. It's official.

231
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:17,824
How are you feeling?

232
00:23:21,632 --> 00:23:23,680
I'm...

233
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:25,568
well, I'm--
How do you feel?

234
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,088
Uh...nervous.

235
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,000
Scared.

236
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,712
This is a big step, Walt.

237
00:23:35,744 --> 00:23:37,792
If we don't
do this right--

238
00:23:37,824 --> 00:23:39,488
We'll be fine.

239
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,504
We will?

240
00:23:46,048 --> 00:23:47,616
Tell me again.

241
00:23:51,424 --> 00:23:55,616
We will be fine.
Believe it.

242
00:23:58,592 --> 00:24:00,128
If we're
going to do this--

243
00:24:00,192 --> 00:24:02,112
I mean, we're really
going to do this--

244
00:24:02,144 --> 00:24:05,216
Then we have to
promise each other

245
00:24:05,248 --> 00:24:07,296
no more secrets.

246
00:24:09,632 --> 00:24:12,704
There can't be any
mistakes like before.

247
00:24:12,736 --> 00:24:15,680
There has to be
complete honesty.

248
00:24:15,712 --> 00:24:18,272
I'm all for that.

249
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:20,608
Good.

250
00:24:21,952 --> 00:24:24,288
Well, then, uh,

251
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,240
how about a drink to celebrate?

252
00:24:26,272 --> 00:24:27,584
Well--

253
00:24:27,616 --> 00:24:30,016
Well, we own a big-ass
car wash now.

254
00:24:30,048 --> 00:24:32,800
We do. I guess
that merits a celebration.

255
00:24:32,832 --> 00:24:34,208
Nothing too expensive.

256
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,000
Right. Right.

257
00:24:36,032 --> 00:24:38,112
- Non-fancy liquor it is.
- Yes.

258
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,352
Just as long
as it gets the job done.

259
00:24:40,384 --> 00:24:41,376
Oop.

260
00:24:46,657 --> 00:24:48,283
<i>Uh, it's me.</i>

261
00:24:49,024 --> 00:24:50,560
<i>I just wanted to say</i>

262
00:24:50,592 --> 00:24:53,440
<i>that I was thinking
about you and the kids,</i>

263
00:24:53,472 --> 00:24:56,288
<i>and, uh...</i>

264
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,112
<i>I love you.</i>

265
00:25:22,368 --> 00:25:23,456
- Just take it off.
- Okay.

266
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:24,448
- Just take it off.
- Okay.

267
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,504
- Just take it off.
- Okay.

268
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:56,960
The sheets, they smell
different than I remember.

269
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,720
Hmm?
Mm-hmm.

270
00:26:00,288 --> 00:26:01,536
Oh.

271
00:26:01,568 --> 00:26:03,232
New fabric softener.

272
00:26:03,264 --> 00:26:04,864
Mmm.

273
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,560
Mm, I like it.

274
00:26:08,544 --> 00:26:10,240
I, uh...

275
00:26:10,272 --> 00:26:13,440
also got a new haircut.

276
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:15,136
Don't know if you--

277
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,632
Oh, yes, I-- I was
going to say something.

278
00:26:17,664 --> 00:26:19,456
Were you, really?

279
00:26:22,304 --> 00:26:23,904
I do like it.

280
00:26:26,144 --> 00:26:27,616
Thanks.

281
00:26:30,816 --> 00:26:34,816
So, um, dinner tomorrow night?

282
00:26:34,848 --> 00:26:39,776
I told Marie that we'd
come over and eat with them.

283
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:43,456
Uh, think maybe you'll be free?

284
00:26:46,528 --> 00:26:47,744
Yeah.

285
00:26:49,056 --> 00:26:50,336
Yeah, we can do that.

286
00:26:50,368 --> 00:26:52,160
That'll--
That'll be nice.

287
00:26:53,856 --> 00:26:55,424
Good.

288
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,192
Marie says
it's about the only thing

289
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,528
that'll get Hank
out of his room.

290
00:27:04,128 --> 00:27:05,792
Mom.

291
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:07,616
Ohh.

292
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,248
Hey, Mom, Dad.

293
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,304
Hi, son.

294
00:27:21,504 --> 00:27:23,424
Where are you?

295
00:27:23,488 --> 00:27:25,408
Uh, we're--
We're back here.

296
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,976
We'll be out in a minute.

297
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,888
Ohh...

298
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,264
He knows that you're here.

299
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:38,336
I'm parked in the driveway.

300
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,648
Oh. This is going to make

301
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,112
for some very interesting
dinner conversation.

302
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,856
He's definitely going to ask

303
00:27:45,888 --> 00:27:48,160
about our living situation now.

304
00:27:48,192 --> 00:27:49,440
Mm.
Mm-hmm.

305
00:27:51,328 --> 00:27:54,080
Maybe, uh...

306
00:27:54,112 --> 00:27:56,896
maybe you should move back in,

307
00:27:56,928 --> 00:27:58,272
you know,

308
00:27:58,304 --> 00:28:01,536
just so it's, uh, easier
to explain to everyone.

309
00:28:03,744 --> 00:28:05,120
You think?

310
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,880
I have to get back to work.

311
00:28:30,912 --> 00:28:33,792
You know, schedule.

312
00:28:33,824 --> 00:28:35,488
Yeah.

313
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:44,672
Whoa. Ohh--

314
00:29:46,528 --> 00:29:47,520
Ahh--

315
00:29:49,216 --> 00:29:50,816
Damn it.

316
00:29:50,848 --> 00:29:52,224
Hey!

317
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:55,040
Hey! This is a two-man job!

318
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,288
I can't do it alone!

319
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,560
I'm done! That's it!
Finished!

320
00:29:58,592 --> 00:30:01,088
Nothing else happens
until I get my partner back.

321
00:30:20,608 --> 00:30:21,696
Jesse?

322
00:30:26,752 --> 00:30:28,512
Where's Jesse?

323
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,336
I need him.

324
00:30:30,368 --> 00:30:31,968
You people have me down here

325
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,136
trying to complete
a two-man operation by myself!

326
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:36,608
It's unacceptable.

327
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,680
It's dangerous
and counterproductive.

328
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:44,320
Jesse operates
the forklift, not me.

329
00:30:44,352 --> 00:30:46,240
That's just one of the many,

330
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,488
many things
he does around the lab

331
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,056
that keeps us on schedule,

332
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,520
so I suggest that you
get him back down here

333
00:30:51,552 --> 00:30:52,672
as soon as you p--

334
00:30:52,704 --> 00:30:55,072
Are you listening to me?

335
00:30:55,136 --> 00:30:56,352
Hello!

336
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,944
Where do you want it?

337
00:31:37,152 --> 00:31:40,576
This is it, right?
Last stop?

338
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:41,952
Last stop?

339
00:31:43,072 --> 00:31:44,320
Hey, I've been counting, yo.

340
00:31:44,352 --> 00:31:45,792
No more pickups after--

341
00:32:01,984 --> 00:32:04,416
Fallacies...

342
00:32:04,448 --> 00:32:06,336
fallacies.

343
00:32:31,296 --> 00:32:34,752
Fallacies, fallacies.

344
00:32:34,784 --> 00:32:38,816
One for you, two for me.

345
00:32:38,848 --> 00:32:42,688
Fallacies, fallacies...

346
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,824
Ohh!

347
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,200
Ohh.

348
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,000
Yeah. I'm gonna need
to be picked up.

349
00:33:56,032 --> 00:33:57,344
Now.

350
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,312
Garcia's on Central.

351
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:04,096
Honk once. I'll meet you
in the parking lot.

352
00:34:10,272 --> 00:34:11,264
Cancel that.

353
00:34:20,928 --> 00:34:22,720
Hey, this dude--

354
00:34:22,752 --> 00:34:24,960
This dude was coming
right at me

355
00:34:24,992 --> 00:34:26,880
with a--
With a shotgun.

356
00:34:26,912 --> 00:34:28,640
All right? They, like,
blocked the alley,

357
00:34:28,672 --> 00:34:30,496
and they were going
to rip us off, man.

358
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,776
I didn't have a choice, okay?

359
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,560
I had to put it in reverse,
slam into the guy's car,

360
00:34:34,592 --> 00:34:37,536
and just--

361
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,912
I saw.

362
00:34:41,408 --> 00:34:42,848
Ah, Jesus.

363
00:34:43,904 --> 00:34:45,376
I just--

364
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,040
I don't know.

365
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:57,696
Go ahead, kid.

366
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:00,704
Smoke up.

367
00:35:22,112 --> 00:35:24,096
Hmm.

368
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,296
Mmm.

369
00:35:41,856 --> 00:35:43,424
Good morning.

370
00:35:43,456 --> 00:35:45,824
Hey. Good morning, son.

371
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:48,192
You want me
to pour you some juice?

372
00:35:48,224 --> 00:35:50,464
I'll take coffee.

373
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,240
Didn't know you started
drinking coffee.

374
00:35:54,272 --> 00:35:58,656
Yeah. I also started tying
my own shoelaces, too,

375
00:35:58,688 --> 00:36:00,480
all by myself.

376
00:36:00,544 --> 00:36:02,496
Go grab a mug.

377
00:36:11,008 --> 00:36:12,960
Milk? Sugar?

378
00:36:12,992 --> 00:36:15,456
Just black.

379
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,728
Black. I like it.

380
00:36:20,224 --> 00:36:22,560
Uh, hey, Dad, I, uh...

381
00:36:22,592 --> 00:36:25,792
I-- I just got to say, um...

382
00:36:25,824 --> 00:36:27,392
I-- I just wanted to say

383
00:36:27,424 --> 00:36:29,728
that it's really cool
to have you here.

384
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,472
Thank you, son.

385
00:36:33,504 --> 00:36:35,552
It's cool to be back home.

386
00:36:36,576 --> 00:36:38,176
It just feels--

387
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:42,656
Mom said you're moving
back in, uh, this Tuesday.

388
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:48,672
She-- She said that?

389
00:36:48,704 --> 00:36:50,976
Yeah.

390
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:53,952
Tuesday, is it? Huh.

391
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,992
How about that?

392
00:37:25,152 --> 00:37:26,080
Jesse.

393
00:37:26,112 --> 00:37:27,936
Jesse!

394
00:37:28,992 --> 00:37:30,368
Yo, what's up?

395
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,256
What are you doing?

396
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,760
Uh, breaking ice.

397
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:34,976
I mean, what are you--

398
00:37:35,008 --> 00:37:36,608
What are you doing here?

399
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,728
Where's your car?

400
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,936
Mike dropped me off.

401
00:37:52,032 --> 00:37:53,120
Jesse.

402
00:37:54,112 --> 00:37:55,456
Jesse!

403
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,552
What happened yesterday?
Where were you?

404
00:37:59,584 --> 00:38:02,048
I was out with Mike
helping him make pickups.

405
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,360
Picking up what?

406
00:38:03,392 --> 00:38:05,312
Cash. Dead drops.

407
00:38:05,344 --> 00:38:09,216
Mike made the pickups,
and I guarded them.

408
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,104
You?

409
00:38:11,136 --> 00:38:12,480
Guarded Mike?

410
00:38:13,568 --> 00:38:15,200
What is this,
some kind of a joke?

411
00:38:15,232 --> 00:38:17,280
Hey, you know what?
Two dudes tried to rob us,

412
00:38:17,312 --> 00:38:19,520
and I saved the stash.
I took care of business,

413
00:38:19,552 --> 00:38:22,624
just like I'm taking care
of business right now.

414
00:38:22,656 --> 00:38:24,064
You want to stand there
dicking around,

415
00:38:24,128 --> 00:38:26,752
or you want to suit up
and get to work?

416
00:38:26,784 --> 00:38:29,376
Get in gear, yo,
if you want to do this

417
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:31,328
because I'm meeting up
with Mike this afternoon.

418
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,408
What, again? Why?

419
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:36,032
Guess I have two jobs now.

420
00:38:55,296 --> 00:38:56,576
<i>May I take your order?</i>

421
00:39:04,064 --> 00:39:05,408
Any injuries?

422
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:08,576
Twisted ankle, nothing too bad.

423
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,256
It all went like you
thought it would,

424
00:39:12,288 --> 00:39:14,560
more or less.

425
00:39:14,592 --> 00:39:16,544
I will, of course,
reimburse you

426
00:39:16,576 --> 00:39:18,304
to the damage to your vehicles.

427
00:39:18,336 --> 00:39:19,360
Hmm.

428
00:39:21,664 --> 00:39:22,624
Questions?

429
00:39:22,688 --> 00:39:26,208
Uh-huh.
More than a few, yeah.

430
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,256
But I know better than to ask.

431
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,656
Anyway, it was like you wanted.

432
00:39:34,688 --> 00:39:36,480
The kid's a hero.

433
00:39:54,528 --> 00:39:55,648
Poo-poo-poo-poo-poo--

434
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,312
Just the idea
of owning a car wash

435
00:39:57,344 --> 00:39:58,976
seems daunting,
but I had to warn myself--

436
00:39:59,008 --> 00:40:00,480
Who is just the most beautiful
little girl in the world?

437
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,600
I think it's you.

438
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:03,552
So coming into
a business like this

439
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,632
that's up and running,
fully operational,

440
00:40:05,696 --> 00:40:07,904
puts us way ahead of the game.

441
00:40:07,968 --> 00:40:09,376
You know, we're
still going to have

442
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:10,656
some change over time--

443
00:40:10,688 --> 00:40:12,128
I think it's you.
Yeah, I do.

444
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,696
But we do have
a staff in place,

445
00:40:13,728 --> 00:40:16,640
so, you know, luckily,
we'll be able to hold on

446
00:40:16,704 --> 00:40:18,368
to most of Bogdan's employees.

447
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,304
We might lose a few to the Ultra
Wash across town, though.

448
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,968
They're making a grab, I hear.

449
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,440
You going to put
the kid to work?

450
00:40:25,472 --> 00:40:26,752
I got school.

451
00:40:26,816 --> 00:40:27,904
I'm not talking about you.

452
00:40:27,936 --> 00:40:29,184
I'm talking about
your baby sister.

453
00:40:29,216 --> 00:40:30,624
I wouldn't let you near my car.

454
00:40:30,688 --> 00:40:33,472
Hey, that's not a bad idea,
you guys.

455
00:40:33,504 --> 00:40:36,160
You should put Holly
on the sign.

456
00:40:36,192 --> 00:40:38,208
Like a mascot?

457
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,224
Like the Gerber baby.

458
00:40:40,256 --> 00:40:42,144
I would get my car
washed there every day

459
00:40:42,176 --> 00:40:43,424
if I saw her face out front.

460
00:40:43,456 --> 00:40:44,544
What about me?

461
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:46,240
The goal is to bring
customers in,

462
00:40:46,272 --> 00:40:47,712
not scare them away, so--

463
00:40:51,232 --> 00:40:53,248
Walt, there's another
bottle in the kitchen.

464
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,336
Just help yourself.

465
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,616
Ah. Good.

466
00:40:57,632 --> 00:40:59,840
Uh, maybe we could
roll uncle Hank

467
00:40:59,872 --> 00:41:00,992
through the car wash.

468
00:41:01,024 --> 00:41:02,272
He could be the first customer.

469
00:41:03,616 --> 00:41:05,952
The wipe-down crew
would clean you up good.

470
00:41:07,136 --> 00:41:08,256
See this, son?

471
00:41:08,288 --> 00:41:09,696
I got your wipe-down
right here, pal.

472
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,160
Hank, can you just
maybe get through one meal

473
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,400
without you saying
something disgusting?

474
00:41:14,464 --> 00:41:16,896
So what are you going
to do with Holly all day?

475
00:41:16,928 --> 00:41:18,272
You can't take her to work

476
00:41:18,304 --> 00:41:21,984
with all those chemicals
and migrants hanging around.

477
00:41:22,016 --> 00:41:23,008
Marie--

478
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,568
What? That can't be safe.

479
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,976
Fortunately, there is,

480
00:41:27,008 --> 00:41:28,640
just five minutes away
from the car wash,

481
00:41:28,672 --> 00:41:31,840
there is the top child care
center in the city.

482
00:41:31,872 --> 00:41:34,240
The National Child Care
Association

483
00:41:34,272 --> 00:41:36,992
gives it really high ratings,
so that's quite a relief,

484
00:41:37,056 --> 00:41:40,320
and, you know, it's just
a walk away if we need it.

485
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,568
I got to tell you,

486
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,576
I'm just-- I'm really,
really impressed.

487
00:41:44,608 --> 00:41:47,488
I mean,
you came together on this,

488
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,792
and I'm really happy
that it's working out for you.

489
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,784
Thanks.

490
00:41:50,816 --> 00:41:51,840
It was a little scary,

491
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,856
but it, uh, needed to be done.

492
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:56,832
And, uh, we get possession
of the keys tomorrow.

493
00:41:56,864 --> 00:41:58,272
Oh, that's awesome.

494
00:41:58,304 --> 00:41:59,328
Yeah.

495
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,800
I can't wait to see

496
00:42:00,832 --> 00:42:02,656
what kind of car
I'll get for my birthday,

497
00:42:02,688 --> 00:42:04,704
now with all this money
rolling in.

498
00:42:04,736 --> 00:42:06,560
I think you've been
spending too much time

499
00:42:06,592 --> 00:42:07,840
around your uncle Hank.

500
00:42:07,872 --> 00:42:09,632
The squeaky
wheel gets the grease.

501
00:42:09,664 --> 00:42:10,912
Right, uncle Hank?

502
00:42:10,944 --> 00:42:12,576
Squeaky and greasy.
That's you, my friend.

503
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,416
Hey, uh, Nick the Greek,

504
00:42:16,448 --> 00:42:18,080
you going to share
that bottle or what?

505
00:42:18,112 --> 00:42:19,840
Oh. Yeah. Sorry.

506
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:21,184
Who's Nick the Greek?

507
00:42:21,216 --> 00:42:23,424
Nick the Greek. He was
a famous big-time card player.

508
00:42:23,456 --> 00:42:24,928
Hank, that's not funny.

509
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,240
What? It's a compliment.

510
00:42:26,272 --> 00:42:27,712
Well, that's even worse, then.

511
00:42:27,744 --> 00:42:31,200
You're giving positive
reinforcement to behavior

512
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:34,720
that Walt is working
very, very hard to change.

513
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,320
Right, Skyler?

514
00:42:36,352 --> 00:42:38,048
Yeah.

515
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,616
I don't see how it's bad, Dad,

516
00:42:39,648 --> 00:42:41,855
just raking in
the beaucoup bucks now.

517
00:42:41,856 --> 00:42:43,104
You know, I just, uh, think

518
00:42:43,136 --> 00:42:45,120
maybe we could
change the subject?

519
00:42:45,152 --> 00:42:48,224
Yeah. Sure. You know.

520
00:42:48,256 --> 00:42:50,176
Absolutely.

521
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:53,312
Hey, uncle Hank, what about
that case you were looking at

522
00:42:53,344 --> 00:42:54,999
with that crazy singing guy?

523
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,368
Ah, I'm off that.

524
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,928
I-- I gave my assessment
to the APD, and I'm done.

525
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,872
The case of the crazy
singing guy. Hmm.

526
00:43:03,904 --> 00:43:06,080
Sounds like an Encyclopedia
Brown story, doesn't it?

527
00:43:06,112 --> 00:43:09,376
Crazy is-- Is-- Is, uh,
is the wrong word.

528
00:43:09,408 --> 00:43:11,200
This guy Gale Boetticher,

529
00:43:11,232 --> 00:43:13,248
he was, uh, he was eccentric.

530
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,744
I mean, a real character,
you know?

531
00:43:15,776 --> 00:43:18,880
He's, uh, he's dead now,
you know.

532
00:43:18,912 --> 00:43:20,544
Huh. Who was he?

533
00:43:20,576 --> 00:43:22,368
He was a meth cook.

534
00:43:22,432 --> 00:43:24,640
Uh, he was a meth chef.

535
00:43:24,672 --> 00:43:27,296
I mean,
we're talking five stars--

536
00:43:27,328 --> 00:43:30,208
Candles and white tablecloths.

537
00:43:30,272 --> 00:43:32,128
Hey, I can't believe
these words

538
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,312
are gonna come out of my mouth,

539
00:43:33,376 --> 00:43:38,336
but he was a genius,
plain and simple.

540
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:42,528
I mean, uh, boy, if you
applied that big brain of his

541
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,064
to something good,
I don't know,

542
00:43:44,096 --> 00:43:45,984
who knows what could have
helped humanity

543
00:43:46,016 --> 00:43:47,232
or something like that,
you know?

544
00:43:47,264 --> 00:43:49,600
I mean, how many actual
geniuses are there

545
00:43:49,632 --> 00:43:51,104
in the world, right?

546
00:43:51,136 --> 00:43:53,792
If he'd kind of taken his life
in a different direction,

547
00:43:53,824 --> 00:43:55,520
who knows?

548
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:59,680
Hank, not to tell you
your business,

549
00:43:59,712 --> 00:44:03,168
but I'm not sure I agree.

550
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,384
What do you mean?

551
00:44:04,416 --> 00:44:05,408
Well, I mean,

552
00:44:05,472 --> 00:44:06,720
you showed me that notebook

553
00:44:06,752 --> 00:44:08,704
and from what
I saw--

554
00:44:08,736 --> 00:44:11,296
And this is just
my humble opinion--

555
00:44:11,328 --> 00:44:14,976
From what I saw
on those papers...

556
00:44:15,008 --> 00:44:16,704
genius?

557
00:44:18,592 --> 00:44:20,320
Not so much.

558
00:44:20,352 --> 00:44:22,848
I mean, there was no reasoning,

559
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,640
no deductions in those pages.

560
00:44:24,672 --> 00:44:27,904
To my eye, all this brilliance

561
00:44:27,936 --> 00:44:29,920
looks like nothing more

562
00:44:29,952 --> 00:44:34,304
than just simple
rote copying--

563
00:44:34,368 --> 00:44:37,440
Probably of
someone else's work.

564
00:44:39,104 --> 00:44:42,560
Believe me, I've been around
enough students to know.

565
00:44:45,696 --> 00:44:50,304
Ah, this genius of yours...

566
00:44:50,336 --> 00:44:53,856
maybe he's still out there.

567
00:45:05,952 --> 00:45:07,264
Hank.

568
00:45:07,296 --> 00:45:08,480
Hey, babe.

569
00:45:09,856 --> 00:45:11,712
Uh, Tim stopped by.

570
00:45:11,776 --> 00:45:13,696
He brought over some file boxes

571
00:45:13,728 --> 00:45:15,104
on that case.

572
00:45:15,136 --> 00:45:17,120
Thought I'd take another peek.

573
00:45:17,152 --> 00:45:18,528
That's great.

574
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,536
Sorry about the mess.

575
00:45:21,568 --> 00:45:23,232
No, no, no. Don't be.

576
00:45:25,088 --> 00:45:26,976
You want me
to make some coffee?

577
00:45:27,008 --> 00:45:28,544
Yeah.

578
00:45:28,576 --> 00:45:30,880
Yeah, that would be good.

579
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,472
Hmm.

580
00:46:02,496 --> 00:46:03,776
You find something?

581
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:09,920
Oh, just this--
This guy I'm looking at.

582
00:46:09,952 --> 00:46:13,440
You know, everything
he-- He-- He buys and eats

583
00:46:13,472 --> 00:46:18,048
is organic, fair trade, vegan.

584
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:25,545
Since when do vegans
eat fried chicken?

Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:03,026 --> 00:00:05,386
What if we took
the kids for a while?

3
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:08,864
- This idea, was it yours?
- It was Skyler's.

4
00:00:09,395 --> 00:00:13,119
Michael Ehrmantraut, we're putting a
surveillance team as we speak.

5
00:00:13,235 --> 00:00:15,838
There is a nanny cam,
I just thought you should know.

6
00:00:15,984 --> 00:00:17,650
- What's your name?
- Todd.

7
00:00:19,597 --> 00:00:20,692
Stop!

8
00:00:20,982 --> 00:00:23,353
Lydia planted this thing,
not the cops.

9
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:25,353
Mr. White, what do you think?

10
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,725
The methylamine keeps
flowing no matter what.

11
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:29,611
We're just getting started.

14
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:14,025
Hey, man,

15
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:16,227
look at the sad sack I found
moping around the lobby.

16
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:18,596
- Hey.
- Ho. Hey, there, Walt.

17
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,131
- How you doing, buddy?
- Good.

18
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:22,533
Listen, I'm sorry to drop
in on you out of the blue.

19
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:24,468
- No, no, no.
- If it's a bad time, I could...

20
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:27,538
No, no. I'm just kind of settling into the
new digs here. What do you think, huh?

21
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:30,675
Wow.
It is very nice.

22
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:33,177
- Yeah. Congratulations again.
- Yeah.

23
00:03:33,211 --> 00:03:35,146
- We're all very proud of you.
- Oh, well, thanks.

24
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,848
You know, my days of chasing
dirt-balls is over.

25
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:40,117
But I'll tell you what,
being a boss--

26
00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:41,953
own kind of grind,
you know what I'm saying?

27
00:03:41,987 --> 00:03:44,372
Uh, Steve,
would you mind if--

28
00:03:44,406 --> 00:03:47,291
I've gotta run something by
Hank, if it's all right.

29
00:03:47,326 --> 00:03:50,244
Yeah. Yeah, hey, somebody's
gotta go chase the bad guys.

30
00:03:50,278 --> 00:03:52,063
- Walt, it's a pleasure seeing you again.
- Hey.

31
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:53,497
- Thanks again, Steve.
- Take care, all right?

32
00:03:53,515 --> 00:03:54,999
- Appreciate it.
- Sure.

33
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:57,785
Hey. Whoa.
Look at that.

34
00:03:57,836 --> 00:03:59,503
- Jesus, Walt.
- Oh.

35
00:03:59,537 --> 00:04:01,405
- That's nice. Let me see that.
- Yeah.

36
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,374
Wow. That's beautiful.

37
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:05,309
Was it a birthday present?

38
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:06,610
Uh, yeah.

39
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:08,612
Well, I mean,
not-- not really.

40
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:10,414
I bought it for myself.

41
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:12,016
Oh.

42
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,218
Hey, have a seat.

43
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:18,856
New car, new watch.

44
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:20,758
Ah, good for you.

45
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:23,527
With all the curve balls that
were thrown at you this year,

46
00:04:23,562 --> 00:04:25,396
you deserve to treat yourself.

47
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,998
I mean, as long as you got

48
00:04:27,032 --> 00:04:29,100
the money to spend, that is.

49
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:31,068
So, how's Sky?

50
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,805
Actually, she went
to work this morning.

51
00:04:34,823 --> 00:04:36,574
She wanted to.

52
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:38,909
She said she needed
to, you know,

53
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:41,445
keep her mind occupied, and...

54
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,848
- That's good. Great, actually.
- Yeah.

55
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:45,716
I mean, as long as
you're all right with her

56
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:47,351
being on her own and stuff.

57
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:48,652
Yeah, well, you know,

58
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:51,188
I'm right there with her
most of the time.

59
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:53,758
And Mariano kind of
keeps an eye on her

60
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:55,092
when I'm not, so...

61
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:56,494
- Good.
- Yeah.

62
00:04:56,528 --> 00:04:58,562
And what about the whole idea
of talking to somebody?

63
00:04:58,597 --> 00:05:01,232
I mean, you know,
Marie goes off about Dave

64
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:03,701
like he's a rock star shrink,
you know?

65
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:05,336
They come in like zombies,

66
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,904
out like larks,
you know what I'm saying?

67
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:07,905
That's great.

68
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:10,707
Actually,
she already found someone.

69
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:12,910
Yeah. Peter...

70
00:05:12,944 --> 00:05:14,979
Uh... hmm.

71
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:17,314
I don't know why I'm drawing
a blank on his last name.

72
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:19,917
Peter... anyway,
he's out in Rio Rancho.

73
00:05:19,951 --> 00:05:22,937
He's supposed to be top notch.
Good. I'm glad you're on it.

74
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:25,156
That's not something
you wanna let fester.

75
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,991
No. No, you don't.

76
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:29,026
You don't.

77
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:32,863
Um, Hank,
I-- I just, uh...

78
00:05:32,898 --> 00:05:36,434
I wanted to thank you and Marie
for watching the kids.

79
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:38,536
No, it's-- it really is--

80
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,471
- No--
- No, it's nice of you, and...

81
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:43,641
I'd like to come by tonight and
see them if that's all right.

82
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:46,277
Oh, of course. What do you mean?
You don't have to ask that.

83
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:48,846
It's great having them.
They're great kids.

84
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,648
I appreciate that.

85
00:05:50,682 --> 00:05:52,149
I do.

86
00:05:57,656 --> 00:06:00,491
Something else
on your mind there, Walt?

87
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:02,460
Walt, feel free to, you know...

88
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:13,304
Skyler doesn't love me anymore.

89
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:18,042
And I don't know
what to do, Hank.

90
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:20,478
I don't.

91
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:21,962
She...

92
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:29,086
She says that I'm
a bad influence on the kids,

93
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:31,238
and, uh,

94
00:06:31,273 --> 00:06:34,792
that I'm not not good for them.

95
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:36,644
Aw, jeez, Walt.

96
00:06:36,678 --> 00:06:38,595
No.

97
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:42,583
She thinks I'm a bad father.

98
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:45,102
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:46,987
Hey, I mean,

100
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:48,873
Sky and you got your issues,

101
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:50,691
but, uh, that there--

102
00:06:50,725 --> 00:06:52,743
That's-- that's...

103
00:06:52,777 --> 00:06:54,211
I mean, I'm no...

104
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:56,847
I'm not an expert
on parenting or anything,

105
00:06:56,882 --> 00:06:58,532
but from where I'm sitting,

106
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:00,951
I just-- I just don't
see it, you know?

107
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:02,920
I mean, I...

108
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:04,655
I think you're great
with the kids.

109
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:06,123
I think you're great
with the kids.

110
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:08,459
You're a provider, uh,

111
00:07:08,493 --> 00:07:11,829
a role model, you know?

112
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:14,732
Hell, the guts you showed
going toe-to-toe with cancer--

113
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:18,435
That alone, that's--
that's an inspiration to me, you know?

114
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,071
No, I've made mistakes,
you know?

115
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:22,389
Yeah, I know.

116
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,708
Listen, I'm gonna get a coffee.
You want a coffee?

117
00:07:24,743 --> 00:07:26,810
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
- I'm gonna have a cup of coffee.

118
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:30,214
I'm gonna give you a moment to--
to just get it together there.

119
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:31,682
Um...

120
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:33,717
You want cream and sugar?

121
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:35,519
Yeah. Hank, I'm sorry.

122
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:37,421
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

123
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:38,589
That...

124
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:40,357
Cup of coffee, right?
All right.

125
00:07:40,392 --> 00:07:43,360
Just take a moment.
Take a moment.

126
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:38,782
You know, you two
are really great together.

127
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:41,285
Take it from me, buddy,

128
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:44,554
it's always darkest
just before the dawn.

129
00:08:44,572 --> 00:08:46,407
Yeah.

130
00:08:49,878 --> 00:08:51,528
What is this place?

131
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:54,365
What is this place?
What are we doing here?

132
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,200
- Get me the table.
- I-I-I can't be here.

133
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:59,370
My-- my daughter-- my little girl,
she's-- she's gonna be home soon.

134
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:00,904
What?
What are you doing?

135
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:02,473
Mike-- Mike-- Mike--

136
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:04,408
Shut up!

137
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:14,601
Give me her phone.

138
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:20,124
All right, Lydia.

139
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:22,693
My friends here
don't know you like I do,

140
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:26,563
so they're very kindly
giving you one last chance.

141
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,637
There's your script.
Study it.

142
00:09:33,672 --> 00:09:35,572
In about 30 seconds,

143
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:38,642
I'm gonna dial Agent Schrader
on your line here,

144
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:41,712
and you're gonna pass along this information,
and then we'll see what we see.

145
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:44,448
But here are the rules...
If you yell for help,

146
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:47,718
try to give the man some kind of coded
message or otherwise tip him off,

147
00:09:47,752 --> 00:09:50,087
I am gonna pull out my pistol

148
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:52,389
and shoot you in the head.

149
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:55,326
Same goes for panicking,
breaking down into tears.

150
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,227
Remember how
you like to do that?

151
00:09:57,262 --> 00:09:58,595
If it happens this time,

152
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,732
I am going
to pull my pistol out,

153
00:10:01,766 --> 00:10:04,902
and I am going to
shoot you in the head.

154
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:07,838
Look at me, not at them.

155
00:10:07,872 --> 00:10:11,208
Lydia, look at me.

156
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:13,811
If you make Schrader suspicious

157
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:15,112
in any way,

158
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:17,247
any way at all,

159
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:19,316
tell me what's
gonna happen next.

160
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:21,285
You'll pull out your gun
and shoot me.

161
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:23,553
- And where will I shoot you?
- In the head.

162
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:25,222
In the head.
That's right.

163
00:10:25,256 --> 00:10:27,391
And it's a pistol, not a gun.

164
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:29,727
I'm expecting precision here.

165
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,695
We up and running?

166
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,331
Yeah.
Um, computer's set.

167
00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:35,599
Okay, Lydia.

168
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:39,837
If you ever needed to give
the performance of a lifetime,

169
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:42,539
it's now.

170
00:10:42,573 --> 00:10:44,608
You're up.

171
00:10:46,978 --> 00:10:48,879
<i>ASAC's office.</i>

172
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:51,882
Hi. Lydia Rodarte-Quayle
calling for Agent Schrader.

173
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,118
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>What's this regarding?</i>

174
00:10:54,152 --> 00:10:58,055
Madrigal Electromotive.
Lydia. Rodarte. Quayle.

175
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:00,307
Hold, please.

176
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:04,361
Hank, Lydia Rodarte-Quayle
on line one.

177
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:09,600
Hank Schrader.
How can I help you, Ms. Quayle?

178
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:12,936
Well, this is kind of
an odd, uh...

179
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:14,972
It's just that I
was in our warehouse,

180
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:16,907
supervising a shipment
of chemicals,

181
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:19,076
when I noticed a device

182
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,678
<i>on the bottom of one of our
barrels of methylamine.</i>

183
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:23,814
- A device?
<i>- Yeah. I-I guess</i>

184
00:11:23,848 --> 00:11:25,115
you'd call it that.

185
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,750
I'm certainly no expert,

186
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:30,387
but it-- it looks to me
like some kind of a--

187
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:33,390
a tracking device
or-- or a GPS.

188
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:36,427
- Huh.
<i>- So I was just wondering</i>

189
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:38,162
if maybe your people
put it there.

190
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:39,696
Not that it's
any of my business,

191
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:41,665
but the last thing
I wanna do is interfere

192
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:45,536
with a law enforcement operation
or a sting...

193
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,905
or whatever you call it.

194
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:50,340
So, I don't know.

195
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,542
Maybe you could
give me some guidance?

196
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,978
Uh, well, I'll tell you what.

197
00:11:55,013 --> 00:11:57,197
Set that barrel aside for me,
if you would,

198
00:11:57,232 --> 00:11:59,683
and I'll look into it
and get back to you.

199
00:11:59,717 --> 00:12:02,820
And in the meantime,
mum's the word, all right?

200
00:12:02,854 --> 00:12:05,239
Yeah. All right.
Sure thing.

201
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,491
<i>Okay, great.
Thanks for the call, Ms. quayle.</i>

202
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:09,610
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

203
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,602
Hey, Gomie, come here,
would ya?

204
00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:19,870
- Yeah?
- Hey, man.

205
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:21,839
<i>You don't know anything</i>
<i>about GPS trackers</i>

206
00:12:21,873 --> 00:12:23,740
<i>on a methylamine barrel,</i>
<i>do you?</i>

207
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:25,692
<i>Madrigal Houston</i>
<i>I'm talking about.</i>

208
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,579
<i>No. Nobody from my
team planted anything. Why?</i>

209
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:31,615
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>
<i>I figured as much.</i>

210
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:34,451
<i>All right. Thanks.</i>

211
00:12:34,486 --> 00:12:37,454
I-I know what you're thinking,
but I didn't do it.

212
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:39,306
I'm telling you,
I didn't plant that thing.

213
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:40,357
Shut up.

214
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:42,893
And there you have it,
like I said.

215
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:45,212
All right.
So now what?

216
00:12:45,246 --> 00:12:46,730
It's not the DEA's,

217
00:12:46,764 --> 00:12:49,183
so Schrader's probably thinking
some crew planted it,

218
00:12:49,234 --> 00:12:51,201
looking for a weak spot
to pull a heist.

219
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:53,787
He's gonna send a team
over to that warehouse.

220
00:12:53,838 --> 00:12:55,639
He's gonna wire it
out the wazoo--

221
00:12:55,673 --> 00:12:57,524
Bugs, cameras,
the whole nine yards.

222
00:12:57,575 --> 00:12:59,209
So the warehouse is too hot.

223
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:01,678
Her supply
is useless to us now.

224
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:05,048
It depends on how fast Schrader
can get his guys there.

225
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,484
We're 900 miles closer,
after all.

226
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,754
I say we keep listening,
suss out how much time we have.

227
00:13:10,788 --> 00:13:13,357
If it's at least 12 hours,
then we head down there,

228
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:15,259
use her security code
to gain access,

229
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:17,594
and we take every barrel
we can get our hands on.

230
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:19,363
U-haul can only take
six or seven

231
00:13:19,397 --> 00:13:20,764
before the suspension
gives out.

232
00:13:20,798 --> 00:13:22,165
It's a stopgap.

233
00:13:22,183 --> 00:13:23,967
But right now,
it's the best we can do.

234
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:28,505
Well, what about her?

235
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,775
You two drive

236
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:34,378
the barrels back tonight.

237
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:36,346
I'll deal with her.

238
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:39,366
No! No, no, no.
You're making a mistake.

239
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,419
This-- this was not me!
I swear to God I didn't do it!

240
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:44,655
I don't know, man. It sounds like
she's telling the truth to me.

241
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:47,925
She has a gun to her head, kid.

242
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:50,527
Everyone sounds like Meryl
Streep with a gun to their head.

243
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:52,496
I'm sorry, Jesse.

244
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:56,133
You're the one who wanted
to put it up to a vote.

245
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:58,101
It's two against one.

246
00:13:58,136 --> 00:13:59,770
Okay.

247
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:02,239
No. No! You can't kill me!
Come on!

248
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:04,541
I swear I didn't do anything!

249
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:07,461
<i>Hey, Janice, give me Doughty
in the Houston office, will you?</i>

250
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:09,546
<i>You got it.</i>

251
00:14:17,188 --> 00:14:18,889
<i>He's on the line.</i>

252
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:20,807
<i>Hey, Erol.
Please tell me you guys</i>

253
00:14:20,842 --> 00:14:22,526
<i>didn't do something</i>
<i>as lamebrained</i>

254
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,778
<i>as put a GPS tracker</i>
<i>on the outside</i>

255
00:14:24,812 --> 00:14:26,429
<i>of a barrel</i>
<i>of methylamine--</i>

256
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:29,316
<i>One earmarked for the Madrigal
warehouse in Houston?</i>

257
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:31,301
<i>Uh, who's asking?</i>

258
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:33,070
<i>Did someone find them?</i>

259
00:14:33,104 --> 00:14:34,771
<i>Jesus.</i>
<i>Are you shitting me?</i>

260
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:37,441
<i>Since when do you put a GPS tracker
on the outside of a barrel?</i>

261
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:39,810
<i>We didn't have time to go in
there with hazard suits, Hank.</i>

262
00:14:39,844 --> 00:14:41,261
<i>They were about to ship.</i>

263
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:43,747
<i>We epoxied them to the bottom.</i>
<i>They were well-hidden.</i>

264
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:45,816
<i>Oh, really?</i>
<i>Well, not well-hidden enough.</i>

265
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,168
<i>How many barrels you tag?</i>

266
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:51,121
<i>All of them. All the ones that were
headed to the warehouse, anyway.</i>

267
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:53,624
<i>Christ. All right.</i>

268
00:14:53,658 --> 00:14:55,792
<i>Well, sit tight.
Let me figure out how to play this.</i>

269
00:14:55,827 --> 00:14:57,477
<i>Next time, a little communication
first, all right?</i>

270
00:14:57,512 --> 00:14:58,895
<i>Yeah, I...</i>
<i>I'm sorry about that.</i>

271
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:01,097
Asshole.

272
00:15:04,636 --> 00:15:08,038
Aside... aside from the fact

273
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:09,606
that we almost killed
this woman,

274
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:12,576
all of those barrels
are already marked.

275
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,511
We solve the problem we can.

276
00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:17,447
This has not changed the
equation one iota for her.

277
00:15:17,482 --> 00:15:19,983
Oh, come on!
You are not seriously

278
00:15:20,018 --> 00:15:21,785
still considering killing me?

279
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:24,888
I saved you! If it weren't for me,
we'd all be in jail right now!

280
00:15:24,922 --> 00:15:28,058
I hate to say it, but
she's-- she's right, Mike.

281
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:31,428
She saved our asses
by finding that thing.

282
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:34,564
She was saving herself.
She's a loose cannon.

283
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:37,334
I am telling you, she will
turn a gun or a badge on us

284
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:39,219
the first chance she gets.

285
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,238
The woman

286
00:15:41,272 --> 00:15:44,474
put a hit out on me.

287
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:46,410
Seriously?

288
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:48,779
Wait. A hit?

289
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:51,481
What?
Like the mafia?

290
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:54,818
Yeah, like the mafia.

291
00:15:54,852 --> 00:15:57,821
Hey! You still need methylamine,
don't you? Right?

292
00:15:57,855 --> 00:15:59,589
You wanna talk methylamine?

293
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:01,558
Then tell your partner
to stop threatening me,

294
00:16:01,592 --> 00:16:03,193
and let's talk.

295
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:05,595
Talk about what?
You heard.

296
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,831
You can't even get us
a single barrel.

297
00:16:07,865 --> 00:16:09,983
Who said anything
about barrels?

298
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:13,837
I'm talking about
an ocean of the stuff.

299
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:22,392
Just give him a minute,
would you?

300
00:16:22,427 --> 00:16:24,027
Trust him.

301
00:16:24,062 --> 00:16:25,462
"Trust him."

302
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:33,403
Okay.
So, let's hear it.

303
00:16:33,438 --> 00:16:36,573
Not without a guarantee that once I
tell you how to get what you want,

304
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,341
I won't be killed anyway.

305
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,010
- Fine. You have my word.
- Not good enough.

306
00:16:41,028 --> 00:16:42,512
Look, lady--

307
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,381
Do you have children?

308
00:16:44,415 --> 00:16:46,450
That has nothing
to do with this.

309
00:16:46,484 --> 00:16:49,986
It's not a trick question.
Why don't you just answer it?

310
00:16:50,021 --> 00:16:52,689
Yes, I have children.
So what?

311
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:55,242
You think that somehow
because we're both parents

312
00:16:55,293 --> 00:16:57,411
that I won't let my partner
do what's necessary?

313
00:16:57,462 --> 00:16:59,746
- Swear on their lives.
- Oh, what?

314
00:16:59,797 --> 00:17:01,982
Swear on your children's lives
that I won't be harmed.

315
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:04,201
Otherwise, how can I trust you?

316
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:07,854
Look, you're
a smart businesswoman.

317
00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:09,839
You understand
the concept of leverage.

318
00:17:09,857 --> 00:17:11,291
Please don't patronize me.
I hate that.

319
00:17:11,325 --> 00:17:13,643
You have none.

320
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:21,485
But trust has to work
both ways, Lydia.

321
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:24,788
Is it true that you put
a hit out on Mike?

322
00:17:27,692 --> 00:17:28,792
Yes.

323
00:17:28,826 --> 00:17:31,060
- Why?
- I was scared.

324
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,764
Of Mike?

325
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:35,749
Not at first.

326
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,502
There are men who used to work with
Gus Fring in custody right now.

327
00:17:38,536 --> 00:17:41,171
Nine of them. They know
everything about me. Everything.

328
00:17:41,205 --> 00:17:42,639
Some of them
even know about you,

329
00:17:42,673 --> 00:17:44,241
assuming you're
the master chemist

330
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:45,976
they're always talking about.

331
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:51,214
And if it's these nine
that you're worried about,

332
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:53,316
why put the hit on Mike?

333
00:17:53,351 --> 00:17:55,252
I had no choice.
I'm not going to prison

334
00:17:55,286 --> 00:17:57,387
and have my daughter raised
in some horrible group home.

335
00:17:57,421 --> 00:17:59,422
Do you have any idea
what those places are like?

336
00:17:59,457 --> 00:18:01,625
I gave him a list of names,

337
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:03,860
but instead of handling it,
he's protecting them.

338
00:18:03,895 --> 00:18:05,562
So I hired someone else.
At that point,

339
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:08,532
there was no option
but to add Mike to the list.

340
00:18:13,337 --> 00:18:16,506
This ocean of methylamine

341
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,360
that you claim
you can get your hands on,

342
00:18:20,394 --> 00:18:23,613
how much are we
talking about, literally?

343
00:18:23,631 --> 00:18:26,650
How does 24,000 gallons sound?

344
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:31,955
Once a week, on a Wednesday,

345
00:18:31,989 --> 00:18:33,924
a freight train
leaves the port of Long Beach

346
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,159
loaded with
industrial chemicals.

347
00:18:36,194 --> 00:18:38,929
There's always at least one
tanker car full of methylamine,

348
00:18:38,963 --> 00:18:41,264
which we import from
a manufacturer in Guangzhou.

349
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:44,184
The train travels east
through Arizona,

350
00:18:44,218 --> 00:18:46,553
stops at a rail yard
outside Flagstaff

351
00:18:46,604 --> 00:18:48,522
where it gets broken down
and rebuilt.

352
00:18:48,556 --> 00:18:50,273
But the methylamine
always moves on,

353
00:18:50,308 --> 00:18:52,809
destined for our pesticide
concerns in Texas and Oklahoma.

354
00:18:52,844 --> 00:18:55,712
Which means that it passes
right through your home state.

355
00:18:55,746 --> 00:18:58,715
There's a remote
three-mile stretch here,

356
00:18:58,749 --> 00:19:00,684
in Mckinley County.

357
00:19:00,718 --> 00:19:02,686
That's where you do it.

358
00:19:04,155 --> 00:19:06,439
That's where
we do what, exactly?

359
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,908
Get your methylamine.

360
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:11,161
Like, rob it?
Like Jesse James?

361
00:19:11,195 --> 00:19:13,997
You want the stuff? I'm offering you
enough to fill a swimming pool.

362
00:19:14,031 --> 00:19:17,601
You are offering us a quick trip to prison.
That's what I'm hearing.

363
00:19:17,635 --> 00:19:20,053
Stopping a train, post 9/11?

364
00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:22,088
You have any idea
how many alarms

365
00:19:22,123 --> 00:19:24,507
that's gonna set off
between here and D.C.?

366
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:26,576
None, if you do it right here.

367
00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:28,545
If a freight train
is stopped in transit

368
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:30,647
anywhere other than
the usual yards or depots--

369
00:19:30,681 --> 00:19:32,849
Absolutely, a signal
will automatically alarm

370
00:19:32,883 --> 00:19:35,051
the FRA and the TSA
Surface Division

371
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:36,853
at the Department
of Homeland Security.

372
00:19:36,888 --> 00:19:38,588
But what you don't know,
and I do,

373
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,791
because my job requires me to keep
track of my buyers' shipments--

374
00:19:41,826 --> 00:19:43,960
This is dark territory.

375
00:19:43,995 --> 00:19:46,596
- What's that?
- Train-speak for an area of no contact.

376
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:48,498
It's a dead zone.

377
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:50,250
No automated
supervision system,

378
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:52,836
no alarms,
no contact with control.

379
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,738
What about cell phones?

380
00:19:54,772 --> 00:19:56,973
- Crew could just call the cops.
- No cellular either.

381
00:19:57,008 --> 00:20:00,076
I'm telling you,
it's the perfect place.

382
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:02,412
You'd have time enough
to stop the train,

383
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:04,781
siphon off as much methylamine
as you can carry,

384
00:20:04,815 --> 00:20:06,249
and get away
before the police--

385
00:20:06,267 --> 00:20:08,184
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

386
00:20:08,218 --> 00:20:10,987
Assuming we can stop
a moving train,

387
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:12,989
how do we know
we have the right one?

388
00:20:13,024 --> 00:20:14,991
And which tanker car is which?

389
00:20:15,026 --> 00:20:17,193
I can't believe that they
would advertise their contents.

390
00:20:17,228 --> 00:20:19,796
Once the train
gets rebuilt in Flagstaff,

391
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,465
a final manifest gets uploaded
to my company's server.

392
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,802
I'll have it for you sometime
between midnight and 2:00 A.M.

393
00:20:25,836 --> 00:20:28,204
That'll give you at least
six hours of lead time.

394
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:29,973
Keep in mind,

395
00:20:30,007 --> 00:20:32,876
I'm taking a huge risk
supplying this information.

396
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,945
I expect to be paid.

397
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:39,215
W-we can talk
percentages later.

398
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,618
You know what this means,
don't you?

399
00:20:41,652 --> 00:20:43,486
We've gotta off the crew.

400
00:20:43,521 --> 00:20:45,188
How do you figure?

401
00:20:45,222 --> 00:20:47,223
Well, if we don't, the
engineer's gonna call the cops

402
00:20:47,258 --> 00:20:49,192
as soon as he
gets out of the dead zone.

403
00:20:49,226 --> 00:20:51,728
- It's only three miles long.
- But we're way out in the boonies.

404
00:20:51,762 --> 00:20:53,630
I don't care
if it's in the Gobi desert.

405
00:20:53,664 --> 00:20:56,900
Once they get word,
the FBI and Homeland Security

406
00:20:56,934 --> 00:20:58,702
are gonna swoop down
with choppers on us

407
00:20:58,736 --> 00:21:00,337
so fast it'll make
our heads spin.

408
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:03,006
And there is no hiding
in that open country.

409
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,908
- How many in the crew?
- Just two--

410
00:21:04,942 --> 00:21:06,409
An engineer and a conductor.

411
00:21:06,443 --> 00:21:08,211
Assuming there are
no security guards.

412
00:21:08,245 --> 00:21:11,398
No guards. It's not like we're
carrying nuclear warheads.

413
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:13,366
Wait. Two guys.

414
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:15,485
Can't we just
tie them up or something?

415
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:18,088
And then what?
Even if we wear a mask,

416
00:21:18,122 --> 00:21:20,623
we're leaving
two witnesses behind.

417
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:22,425
Bottom line,

418
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,361
I have done this
long enough to know

419
00:21:24,395 --> 00:21:27,063
that there are
two kinds of heists:

420
00:21:27,098 --> 00:21:29,966
Those where the guys
get away with it

421
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:32,452
and those that leave witnesses.

422
00:21:32,503 --> 00:21:34,537
Give me a break.

423
00:21:34,572 --> 00:21:36,439
You guys were gonna murder me.

424
00:21:36,474 --> 00:21:39,142
I thought
you were professionals.

425
00:21:41,545 --> 00:21:44,714
Can you say "ASAC"?

426
00:21:44,749 --> 00:21:47,150
"Aaay-SAC."
Can you say that?

427
00:21:47,184 --> 00:21:49,869
Say,
"ASAC Schrader."

428
00:21:49,904 --> 00:21:51,688
If those turn out
to be her first words,

429
00:21:51,722 --> 00:21:53,356
I will beat you with my shoe.

430
00:21:53,391 --> 00:21:55,225
Don't listen to him, Holly.

431
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:57,727
Aw, I'm just telling it
like it is, babe.

432
00:21:57,762 --> 00:22:00,163
Boss man.
I'm the boss man.

433
00:22:00,197 --> 00:22:02,032
Say, "boss man."

434
00:22:02,066 --> 00:22:04,617
Am I the boss man?
I'm the boss.

435
00:22:04,652 --> 00:22:06,619
Hey, that better be
something from a boob

436
00:22:06,654 --> 00:22:08,538
instead of some fake soy crap.

437
00:22:08,572 --> 00:22:11,007
- Yeah, yeah.
- My little girl--

438
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,359
- Your little girl. Oh.
- ...deserves the real McCoy.

439
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,829
- Oh, no. See?
- Okay.

440
00:22:15,863 --> 00:22:18,665
She doesn't want it.
No, she wants me.

441
00:22:18,716 --> 00:22:21,051
She wants me.

442
00:22:22,436 --> 00:22:25,955
Yeah, my little girl,
'cause I'm not giving her back.

443
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,290
Yeah, I know.

444
00:22:27,324 --> 00:22:29,392
What about emo McGee?

445
00:22:29,427 --> 00:22:31,528
Has he come out
of his room today?

446
00:22:31,562 --> 00:22:32,829
Barely.

447
00:22:32,863 --> 00:22:34,597
When he does, he barely talks.

448
00:22:34,632 --> 00:22:36,850
Yeah, well, what do
you expect, you know?

449
00:22:36,901 --> 00:22:39,936
His parents treat him
like he's a baby there.

450
00:22:47,845 --> 00:22:50,847
Flynn, do you want me to
heat up some of that lasagna

451
00:22:50,881 --> 00:22:52,949
to hold you over till dinner?

452
00:22:52,983 --> 00:22:54,150
No.

453
00:22:54,185 --> 00:22:56,319
Hey, I picked up <i>Heat</i>
on BluRay.

454
00:22:56,353 --> 00:22:57,787
Wanna watch it with me later?

455
00:22:57,822 --> 00:22:59,389
No.

456
00:22:59,423 --> 00:23:02,725
And you can keep
talking about me now.

457
00:23:06,564 --> 00:23:09,699
Well, if no one else is gonna
offer an opinion, I will.

458
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:11,601
We do it
the old-fashioned way.

459
00:23:11,635 --> 00:23:13,603
We hit skid row,
the Crystal Palace,

460
00:23:13,637 --> 00:23:15,204
all the halfway houses,

461
00:23:15,222 --> 00:23:16,973
scrounge up about
a dozen skells,

462
00:23:17,007 --> 00:23:18,942
and put them to work
smurfing cold pills.

463
00:23:18,976 --> 00:23:20,877
You mean switch back
to a pseudo cook.

464
00:23:20,895 --> 00:23:22,846
You're the chemist.
Admittedly,

465
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,814
it's gonna
cut down on our output.

466
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:27,167
Like a factor of four or five.

467
00:23:27,201 --> 00:23:30,587
It also means that
we will eat $80,000

468
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:32,956
we just invested
in our new lab equipment,

469
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,358
which is only good
for a P2P cook.

470
00:23:35,392 --> 00:23:37,794
You know, I don't have
to do the math to know

471
00:23:37,828 --> 00:23:40,346
that we'd be making
a fraction of the profit.

472
00:23:40,381 --> 00:23:45,034
And making less money
is better than making nothing.

473
00:23:45,069 --> 00:23:48,304
Oh, yeah, Mike?
Well, why don't you tell us why?

474
00:23:48,339 --> 00:23:51,541
Why is making nothing
not an option?

475
00:23:51,575 --> 00:23:53,176
- Walter--
- Let me tell you why.

476
00:23:53,194 --> 00:23:55,645
It's because of your nine
guys in lockup, right?

477
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,614
You broke it, you pay for it.

478
00:23:57,648 --> 00:23:59,248
And we've talked about
this plenty already.

479
00:23:59,266 --> 00:24:01,351
Well, maybe we better
talk about it a little more,

480
00:24:01,385 --> 00:24:03,586
because what it sounds like
you're telling me, Mike,

481
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:05,288
is that from now on,

482
00:24:05,322 --> 00:24:08,224
we have no choice but to do
this piddling pseudo cook

483
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:10,360
so that we can pay back
your guys.

484
00:24:10,394 --> 00:24:13,546
Or else what? Or else they're gonna
rat on us, and we end up in prison.

485
00:24:13,581 --> 00:24:17,000
Yeah? And it sounds like
what you're telling me, Walter,

486
00:24:17,034 --> 00:24:19,502
is that you
wanna do this heist,

487
00:24:19,537 --> 00:24:22,572
even if it means killing
a couple of innocent men.

488
00:24:22,606 --> 00:24:24,908
That what you want?

489
00:24:24,942 --> 00:24:26,576
You know, I don't know why

490
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,595
you insist on putting
words in my mouth here.

491
00:24:28,646 --> 00:24:30,914
What if we can
rip off that train,

492
00:24:30,948 --> 00:24:34,684
and no one ever knows
it got robbed?

493
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:49,781
Maybe...

494
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,971
Just maybe.

495
00:25:07,383 --> 00:25:09,734
It'll come from that direction.

496
00:25:36,695 --> 00:25:38,696
775...

497
00:25:42,451 --> 00:25:43,952
800...

498
00:25:45,304 --> 00:25:47,822
Oh.

499
00:25:47,857 --> 00:25:51,042
814.

500
00:25:53,212 --> 00:25:55,930
Wow.
Wait a minute.

501
00:26:01,837 --> 00:26:06,107
It's perfect!
Yeah, we do it here.

502
00:26:07,476 --> 00:26:09,511
We do it right here.

503
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,957
How are we looking, Mike?

504
00:26:29,415 --> 00:26:31,232
All clear.

505
00:26:31,267 --> 00:26:32,734
<i>Copy that.</i>

506
00:26:39,675 --> 00:26:41,842
Go down, go down.

507
00:26:41,861 --> 00:26:43,511
All right.

508
00:26:43,546 --> 00:26:45,513
That's good, Fernando.

509
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:02,197
All right.

510
00:27:04,183 --> 00:27:06,401
This one.

511
00:27:06,435 --> 00:27:07,568
Whoo.

512
00:27:11,207 --> 00:27:12,924
- You good?
- Yeah.

513
00:27:17,246 --> 00:27:19,180
- What's your name again?
- Todd.

514
00:27:19,215 --> 00:27:20,848
Todd, on the day,

515
00:27:20,883 --> 00:27:22,717
are you gonna be able
to make this climb?

516
00:27:22,751 --> 00:27:25,019
Yes, sir.
I'll be ready.

517
00:27:25,054 --> 00:27:27,055
All right.

518
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:28,990
You mind if I ask you
a question?

519
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:30,358
No. Go ahead.

520
00:27:30,392 --> 00:27:32,810
Well, I get why we want
the tank for the methylamine.

521
00:27:32,845 --> 00:27:35,446
But why this other one
for the water?

522
00:27:35,497 --> 00:27:37,498
Well...

523
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:39,867
Jesse, it's your idea.

524
00:27:39,902 --> 00:27:41,836
You wanna fill him in?

525
00:27:41,854 --> 00:27:43,538
It's all about the weight, yo.

526
00:27:43,572 --> 00:27:45,506
The tanker
we're gonna hit--

527
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:47,909
it gets weighed once when it
gets loaded in Long Beach,

528
00:27:47,943 --> 00:27:50,745
and then again when
it's unloaded in Texas.

529
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:52,914
If the weights don't match,

530
00:27:52,948 --> 00:27:54,949
the train company's gonna know
it got robbed.

531
00:27:54,984 --> 00:27:56,451
Okay.

532
00:27:56,518 --> 00:27:59,254
Boosting methylamine from a
train is, like, a major rap.

533
00:27:59,288 --> 00:28:02,607
The point is,
no one other than us

534
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:05,543
can ever know that
this robbery went down.

535
00:28:05,577 --> 00:28:06,994
Nobody.

536
00:28:07,012 --> 00:28:08,630
You got it?

537
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:12,800
Yeah. Absolutely.

538
00:28:12,835 --> 00:28:15,019
Are you sure?

539
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,904
Yes, sir.

540
00:28:16,938 --> 00:28:18,790
With all that said,

541
00:28:18,824 --> 00:28:21,309
the whole thing relies on us

542
00:28:21,343 --> 00:28:23,278
replacing the weight
of methylamine we steal

543
00:28:23,312 --> 00:28:24,746
with the same weight in water.

544
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,881
Right on. So they'll never
know we hit them. Cool.

545
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:29,217
Aqueous methylamine
is water-based,

546
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:31,286
yet it weighs
slightly less than water.

547
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,538
So, we will be removing

548
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:36,424
a thousand gallons of methylamine
from the tanker car,

549
00:28:36,442 --> 00:28:37,825
but replacing it

550
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,995
with about nine-tenths
of that volume in water,

551
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:44,866
which comes to
900.24 gallons.

552
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,768
Actually, Jesse,

553
00:28:46,802 --> 00:28:48,569
let's make that an even 920

554
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:51,706
to account for spillage and
whatever will remain in the hose.

555
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,408
How we doing, by the way?

556
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:55,376
Uh, 850.

557
00:28:55,411 --> 00:28:57,412
- We're almost there.
- All right.

558
00:28:57,446 --> 00:28:59,314
But won't they figure out
they got robbed anyway

559
00:28:59,348 --> 00:29:01,048
on account of getting
watered-down methylamine?

560
00:29:01,066 --> 00:29:03,718
Well, out of 24,000 gallons,

561
00:29:03,736 --> 00:29:08,255
it'll only amount to about
four percent dilution, so...

562
00:29:08,273 --> 00:29:11,376
But, yes, you're right.
They will notice.

563
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:15,013
At which point,
they will blame China

564
00:29:15,064 --> 00:29:18,649
for sending
a marginally weaker batch.

565
00:29:18,701 --> 00:29:22,220
Damn, you guys thought
of everything.

566
00:29:30,579 --> 00:29:32,613
Flynn...

567
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:35,416
Flynn, open the door.

568
00:29:35,451 --> 00:29:38,353
Just come out and talk to me.

569
00:29:38,387 --> 00:29:41,589
I'm staying.
That's all I have to say.

570
00:29:46,061 --> 00:29:47,995
What's going on?

571
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,798
You got what you wanted,
that's what.

572
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:53,368
Congratulations.

573
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:06,314
It's me. Open up.

574
00:30:09,585 --> 00:30:12,120
- Come on, Junior.
- I'm not gonna ask twice.

575
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:14,789
What?

576
00:30:14,823 --> 00:30:16,824
You know what.

577
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:19,660
Are you seriously kicking
me out of my own house?

578
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:21,529
Are you seriously doing that?

579
00:30:21,563 --> 00:30:23,831
We are not kicking you
out of anywhere, son.

580
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:25,333
We love you.

581
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,769
And this is your house
as much as it is ours.

582
00:30:27,803 --> 00:30:30,671
But your mom and I need some
time alone, and you know that.

583
00:30:30,706 --> 00:30:32,123
We explained that to you.

584
00:30:32,157 --> 00:30:33,708
You haven't
explained jack shit.

585
00:30:33,742 --> 00:30:36,711
You want me out?
Explain to me why.

586
00:30:36,745 --> 00:30:38,612
Why do I have to go
to Uncle Hank's?

587
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,516
Give me the exact reason,
or I'm not going anywhere.

588
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:45,002
This is not gonna be a debate.

589
00:30:45,037 --> 00:30:46,988
What's going on?

590
00:30:47,022 --> 00:30:49,056
Why can't anybody
tell me anything?

591
00:30:49,074 --> 00:30:51,626
I want one good reason.

592
00:30:53,361 --> 00:30:56,564
Because we're your parents,
and you're our child.

593
00:30:56,598 --> 00:30:59,033
That's reason enough.
Now, please, do as I ask.

594
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:03,137
Now.

595
00:31:07,209 --> 00:31:08,943
It'll pass.
He'll understand.

596
00:31:08,977 --> 00:31:11,179
Don't start, Walt.

597
00:31:11,213 --> 00:31:14,015
I won't change my mind
about you.

598
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,251
Ever.

599
00:31:17,285 --> 00:31:19,453
Well, I don't accept that.
You're my wife.

600
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:22,190
I'm not your wife,
I'm your hostage.

601
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:27,294
But since you insist
on keeping me imprisoned,

602
00:31:27,312 --> 00:31:28,946
I'll make you a deal.

603
00:31:28,997 --> 00:31:32,533
I will launder your money,
I'll keep your secrets,

604
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:35,369
but the kids will stay
at Hank and Marie's,

605
00:31:35,404 --> 00:31:38,172
where they have a chance
of being safe.

606
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:43,311
Think you've seen
too many movies.

607
00:31:43,345 --> 00:31:47,048
Our children are not in danger.

608
00:31:47,082 --> 00:31:49,483
Just a couple of days ago,

609
00:31:49,501 --> 00:31:52,386
you told me that a man
held a gun to your head.

610
00:31:52,404 --> 00:31:55,223
You said it like
it was a point of pride.

611
00:31:55,257 --> 00:31:57,425
There's nothing you can say
that'll convince me

612
00:31:57,459 --> 00:32:00,328
there won't come a day that
somebody will knock on that door,

613
00:32:00,362 --> 00:32:03,498
looking to harm you
or me or all of us.

614
00:32:03,532 --> 00:32:07,485
And when that day comes,
the children cannot be here.

615
00:32:09,705 --> 00:32:11,906
You agree to that,

616
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,374
and I will be

617
00:32:13,408 --> 00:32:16,878
whatever kind of partner
you want me to be.

618
00:32:29,725 --> 00:32:31,325
Okay.

619
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:39,767
By the way,

620
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:43,354
you're visiting a therapist
from Rio Rancho.

621
00:32:43,388 --> 00:32:46,473
Peter.
Last name-- up to you.

622
00:32:47,576 --> 00:32:49,744
Out burying bodies?

623
00:32:54,316 --> 00:32:56,784
Robbing a train.

624
00:33:24,026 --> 00:33:25,493
<i>Yeah?</i>

625
00:33:25,527 --> 00:33:29,130
It's me.
I've got it.

626
00:33:30,867 --> 00:33:33,635
Okay, Mr. White,
everything's set.

627
00:35:32,988 --> 00:35:34,655
Hey, Wallace!
Up ahead!

628
00:35:35,891 --> 00:35:38,592
Stop the train now!

629
00:35:58,147 --> 00:36:01,132
Stop the train!

630
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,785
Now. Go, go, go.

631
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:51,932
Jesus. Thank God you guys
weren't asleep at the switch.

632
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:54,335
It'd be like pancake city
out here.

633
00:36:54,369 --> 00:36:56,437
Oh, man.

634
00:36:56,471 --> 00:36:58,539
You believe this?

635
00:36:58,574 --> 00:37:00,775
I mean, shit fire
and save the matches.

636
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:03,411
Talk about bum luck.

637
00:37:03,445 --> 00:37:06,414
Hey, man, I'm sorry to put
you guys out like this.

638
00:37:06,448 --> 00:37:07,882
What's the trouble with it?

639
00:37:07,916 --> 00:37:09,984
No clue. I was just
driving down the road.

640
00:37:10,018 --> 00:37:12,970
All of a sudden, the old cow
just bellied up and died on me.

641
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:14,922
Hey, either one of you guys
know about engines?

642
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,224
Oh, of course you do.

643
00:37:16,258 --> 00:37:18,793
That's why they call you
an engineer. Right?

644
00:37:21,196 --> 00:37:23,414
Think it's, uh...

645
00:37:23,448 --> 00:37:25,366
Think it's in there
or something.

646
00:37:25,384 --> 00:37:26,834
- You think?
- Yeah.

647
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,153
Probably a pretty good bet.

648
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,607
When was the last time
you changed the oil?

649
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:34,575
I don't know, man.
I just drive it.

650
00:37:35,694 --> 00:37:37,478
Now. Go, go, go.

651
00:37:37,513 --> 00:37:38,913
We're on.

652
00:38:56,942 --> 00:38:58,292
- Good?
- Yeah.

653
00:38:58,327 --> 00:38:59,627
Go!

654
00:39:21,883 --> 00:39:23,484
It looks good up here.

655
00:39:23,518 --> 00:39:25,119
How about this one?
Hold up.

656
00:39:25,153 --> 00:39:28,189
There it is.
I think this is the one.

657
00:39:28,223 --> 00:39:30,641
- We good?
- Yeah.

658
00:39:30,692 --> 00:39:32,943
Hey, you wanna get in there,
give it a whirl?

659
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:35,196
All right.
Let me give it a try.

660
00:39:46,141 --> 00:39:48,059
- Ready?
- Ready.

661
00:39:50,278 --> 00:39:52,413
- Nothing?
- Try again.

662
00:39:55,717 --> 00:39:57,785
- Nothing.
- All right. Uh...

663
00:39:57,819 --> 00:39:59,787
Maybe if we all pushed?

664
00:40:00,906 --> 00:40:02,873
All right.
It's worth a try.

665
00:40:05,727 --> 00:40:08,145
You got any other ideas,
you just shout them out.

666
00:40:08,196 --> 00:40:10,114
Not at the moment, I don't.

667
00:40:12,417 --> 00:40:14,902
You coming?

668
00:40:14,936 --> 00:40:16,971
So far, so good.

669
00:40:17,939 --> 00:40:19,940
Give me a status.

670
00:40:19,975 --> 00:40:22,543
Uh, we're at

671
00:40:22,577 --> 00:40:25,129
300 gallons and counting.

672
00:40:27,265 --> 00:40:29,884
And water is going...

673
00:40:32,521 --> 00:40:35,389
Now.

674
00:40:35,424 --> 00:40:38,893
Water's going in now.
We're going with water now.

675
00:40:48,437 --> 00:40:49,854
- Good?
- Yeah.

676
00:40:49,888 --> 00:40:51,739
All right.

677
00:40:59,765 --> 00:41:02,249
Ready? One,

678
00:41:02,267 --> 00:41:04,151
two, three.

679
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,845
You did remember
to put it in neutral, right?

680
00:41:14,896 --> 00:41:16,647
Yeah, man.
Give me a little credit.

681
00:41:43,308 --> 00:41:45,476
Uh-oh.

682
00:41:45,527 --> 00:41:47,561
You sure you're not out of gas?

683
00:41:47,596 --> 00:41:49,830
I got a full tank here.

684
00:41:49,865 --> 00:41:52,750
Doesn't make any sense.
Everything looks good.

685
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:56,086
Why don't we just
keep going over it?

686
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:58,756
There's gotta be
something loose somewhere.

687
00:42:05,614 --> 00:42:08,115
Damn, buddy. Picked a hell
of a place to break down.

688
00:42:08,149 --> 00:42:09,667
I know, right?
Crazy.

689
00:42:09,701 --> 00:42:11,619
Hey, you know anything
about engines?

690
00:42:11,653 --> 00:42:14,538
Not a whole lot.
I can push you off the tracks at least.

691
00:42:14,589 --> 00:42:16,990
Oh, gee, man, I wouldn't want
you to mess up your ride.

692
00:42:17,008 --> 00:42:19,343
I'll go slow.
Won't get a scratch.

693
00:42:19,377 --> 00:42:20,845
You'll screw up
your nice shiny bumper.

694
00:42:20,879 --> 00:42:22,996
Hey, we're running late
because of you, buddy.

695
00:42:23,014 --> 00:42:25,216
- The man said it was no problem.
- Yeah. Come on already.

696
00:42:25,267 --> 00:42:26,834
And thank you, by the way.

697
00:42:26,852 --> 00:42:29,520
Yeah, yeah.
Absolutely, pal. Thanks.

698
00:42:53,378 --> 00:42:56,964
Jesus. Walter, we've got
a good samaritan on the scene.

699
00:42:56,998 --> 00:42:59,466
You pull your guys
off that train right now.

700
00:42:59,501 --> 00:43:01,135
We're not done yet.

701
00:43:18,436 --> 00:43:21,355
The track is clear, Walter.
I said get outta there.

702
00:43:32,534 --> 00:43:34,618
Thank you, mister.
Much obliged.

703
00:43:34,669 --> 00:43:36,337
Glad we could
work that out for you.

704
00:43:36,371 --> 00:43:38,122
Yeah, no problem.

705
00:43:38,173 --> 00:43:40,090
You want a ride into town?

706
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:42,509
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

707
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:51,969
Walter, they are back
in the locomotive.

708
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,687
<i>If you do not abort right now,</i>

709
00:43:53,722 --> 00:43:55,639
<i>you are gonna</i>
<i>get us all busted.</i>

710
00:44:06,568 --> 00:44:08,435
- Ready?
- Yeah.

711
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,375
Mr. White...

712
00:44:19,331 --> 00:44:20,881
Hey!

713
00:44:20,916 --> 00:44:24,051
Hold it!
Hold it steady!

714
00:44:27,288 --> 00:44:28,505
Now!

715
00:44:33,395 --> 00:44:35,512
Close it up!
Close it up!

716
00:45:16,104 --> 00:45:17,638
Todd!

717
00:45:17,672 --> 00:45:20,975
Get off!
Get off!

718
00:45:54,709 --> 00:45:56,677
Yeah, bitch!
Oh!

719
00:45:56,711 --> 00:45:59,880
- We did it.
- Oh, yeah!

720
00:45:59,898 --> 00:46:03,734
Oh, my--

721
00:46:03,768 --> 00:46:06,353
Oh, yeah!

722
00:46:06,387 --> 00:46:07,988
Ohh!

723
00:46:41,523 --> 00:46:43,273
No!

724
00:46:43,308 --> 00:46:44,641
No! No!

725
00:46:46,394 --> 00:46:49,229
No.

726

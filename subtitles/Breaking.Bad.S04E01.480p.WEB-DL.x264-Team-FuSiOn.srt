1
00:00:44,258 --> 00:00:45,671
How's it coming?

2
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:49,049
Very, very well.

3
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:52,219
It's a flurry of deliveries.

4
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,636
Feels like Christmas morning.

5
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:57,839
Ah, it's exciting.

6
00:00:58,928 --> 00:01:00,227
It's really coming together.

7
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,937
And I would like to point out

8
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,899
that if you have any
very understandable questions

9
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,551
about the price tag...

10
00:01:09,389 --> 00:01:11,739
That sound... Quality.

11
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,702
At Pfizer, at Merck,

12
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,202
that unit would be right at home.

13
00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:18,204
That goes for all of it.

14
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,976
Good.

15
00:01:21,101 --> 00:01:22,792
I want you to have what you need.

16
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:27,440
Oh. Well, I doff
my proverbial cap to you, sir.

17
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,352
When do you think
we'll be up and running?

18
00:01:30,477 --> 00:01:31,592
Within a month, I'd say.

19
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,047
Two weeks.

20
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,664
Uh, yeah, two weeks.

21
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:41,811
Good. Very good.

22
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,101
By the way,

23
00:01:43,226 --> 00:01:45,670
that sample you asked me to run,

24
00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:50,142
I ran it, and it is quite good.

25
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:51,612
Thank you very much, Gale.

26
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,179
You can give that
to Victor to discard.

27
00:01:53,304 --> 00:01:54,907
Uh, sure.

28
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,416
Is that our competition?

29
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:58,785
I'm sorry?

30
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,419
The, uh...

31
00:02:00,544 --> 00:02:02,855
It really is quite good.

32
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,624
The purity, of course,
I'm speaking of,

33
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,044
speaking strictly in chemical terms.

34
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,029
And I can't, as of yet,
account for the blue color,

35
00:02:10,154 --> 00:02:15,101
but, uh... if that
is our competition,

36
00:02:15,226 --> 00:02:17,370
we have our work cut out for us,

37
00:02:17,495 --> 00:02:19,140
so to speak.

38
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,974
You don't have any competition, Gale,

39
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,743
not as far as I'm concerned.

40
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,070
After all, how pure can pure be?

41
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:30,442
Well, it can be pretty darn pure.

42
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,030
Mr. Fring, I can guarantee you

43
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:38,367
a purity of 96%.
I'm proud of that figure.

44
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:41,330
It's a hard-earned figure, 96.

45
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,040
However, this other product is 99,

46
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:48,571
maybe even a touch beyond that.

47
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:52,047
I'd need an instrument
called a gas chromatograph

48
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,884
to say for sure, but, uh,

49
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,348
that last 3%, it may
not sound like a lot,

50
00:02:59,473 --> 00:03:01,517
but it is.

51
00:03:01,642 --> 00:03:03,652
It's tremendous.

52
00:03:03,777 --> 00:03:07,256
It's a tremendous gulf.

53
00:03:07,381 --> 00:03:09,690
Gale, for our purposes,

54
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,735
96% will do just fine.

55
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:16,433
Please, don't let this trouble you.

56
00:03:16,558 --> 00:03:20,504
Yeah. It's just...

57
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:23,541
I'd love to know who synthesized it

58
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:24,997
is all.

59
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,814
A man who wants to work with me.

60
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:32,004
A trained chemist, like yourself.

61
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,632
But it won't happen.

62
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,093
I don't consider him a professional.

63
00:03:38,581 --> 00:03:43,265
If he's not, I don't know
what that makes me.

64
00:03:43,885 --> 00:03:46,310
I'm not trying to talk
myself out of a job.

65
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,897
With this person,
there are other considerations.

66
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:54,735
His is the best I've
ever seen, hands down.

67
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:59,865
And I look at this
place that you've built,

68
00:04:00,235 --> 00:04:02,409
the money you're investing,

69
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,954
sparing no expense.

70
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,110
And I know...

71
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:13,183
I know that you want the best.


73
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,440
6353 Juan Tabo.

74
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:14,899
Apartment 6.

75
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:17,844
No, no. Eubank's west.

76
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:19,361
It's between Eubank and Spain,

77
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,655
But Mazatlan's closest.

78
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:24,519
I don't know.
I just heard the one,

79
00:05:24,644 --> 00:05:26,789
just the one single, like,
you know, like a backfire,

80
00:05:26,914 --> 00:05:28,224
like a truck backfiring.

81
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:29,455
I came out of my apartment...

82
00:05:29,717 --> 00:05:31,259
A couple of us came out.

83
00:05:31,384 --> 00:05:32,708
No. No, nobody saw it.

84
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,496
Did you guys see anybody?

85
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:36,864
Guys, did you?

86
00:05:36,989 --> 00:05:39,033
I don't know if they
speak English too good.

87
00:05:39,158 --> 00:05:40,100
They're just shaking their heads.

88
00:05:40,225 --> 00:05:41,402
I don't think they saw anybody.

89
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:42,843
It was just this one loud...

90
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,172
This... This very loud pop,
and that was all.

91
00:05:45,297 --> 00:05:47,398
No arguing or like that.

92
00:05:49,134 --> 00:05:50,877
So you guys good in directions there?

93
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:52,269
You want me to...

94
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:56,148
They coming east or west?

95
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,585
If they're heading east,

96
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,736
tell them there's an Exxon
on their left-hand side.

97
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,590
Then it's straight residential.

98
00:06:02,715 --> 00:06:04,448
You want me to what? Yeah.

99
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,586
No. I'll stay on the line.

100
00:06:11,392 --> 00:06:12,968
You know him?

101
00:06:13,093 --> 00:06:14,637
We all heard this shot.

102
00:06:14,762 --> 00:06:16,705
Hey, I don't think
you ought to go in there.

103
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,800
Mister, this is a crime scene.
You don't want to touch anything.

104
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,133
Mister...

105
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,886
Mister, are you listening to me?

106
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,573
You little bastard.

107
00:06:48,428 --> 00:06:49,661
Drive.

108
00:06:50,663 --> 00:06:52,204
Drive!

109
00:08:27,093 --> 00:08:28,659
What the hell happened?

110
00:08:30,562 --> 00:08:31,629
He's gone?

111
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:34,890
Look at me.

112
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,677
Gone?

113
00:08:36,802 --> 00:08:37,601
You sure?

114
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,513
Gone?

115
00:08:39,638 --> 00:08:42,582
Splattered all over.

116
00:08:42,707 --> 00:08:44,785
Oh, Jesus.

117
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,010
Oh, shit.

118
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,623
All right.

119
00:08:50,748 --> 00:08:53,259
So...

120
00:08:53,384 --> 00:08:54,452
Shit.

121
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,063
All right, you do a sweep?

122
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:58,998
I couldn't.
People there.

123
00:09:00,392 --> 00:09:01,702
People?

124
00:09:01,827 --> 00:09:04,272
He get himself seen by these people?

125
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:05,629
What about you?

126
00:09:08,868 --> 00:09:10,050
What about you?

127
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,511
Yeah. So what?

128
00:09:13,806 --> 00:09:16,108
Just another looky-loo.

129
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:30,654
I guess I'd better
get this over with.

130
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,261
Hey.

131
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:03,097
Oh, geez, I... I... I woke you up.

132
00:10:03,222 --> 00:10:04,772
- I woke you up.
- No, it's okay.

133
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,774
I needed to get up anyway.

134
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,734
Are you coming in?

135
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,362
No, no. It's kind of my
only time to run errands.

136
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,988
I just needed to...
Ah.

137
00:10:18,605 --> 00:10:19,537
Sorry.

138
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,664
It's okay.

139
00:10:22,142 --> 00:10:26,613
And thank you, big time, as always.

140
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,465
They seem to be getting
bigger instead of smaller,

141
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:35,094
and I'm not really sure
what that's all about.

142
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,433
Please, for God's sake,

143
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,391
tell me if this is getting
to be too much for you guys.

144
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:41,703
Absolutely not, okay?

145
00:10:41,828 --> 00:10:43,144
It's absolutely fine.

146
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,430
Okay.

147
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,902
Does this mean what I think it means?

148
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,447
What?

149
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,073
You and Walt?

150
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,409
What?

151
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,537
His car's parked in the driveway.
It's not a state secret.

152
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,428
I... uh, all right.
Okay. I'm not pressing.

153
00:11:04,553 --> 00:11:06,297
I just...

154
00:11:06,422 --> 00:11:08,098
I think that it's great.

155
00:11:08,223 --> 00:11:10,268
That's all, all right?

156
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,093
I'm out of here.
Okay.

157
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:17,031
A big howdy-do to Mr. I'm-Not-Here.

158
00:13:47,857 --> 00:13:48,967
Breakfast?

159
00:13:49,092 --> 00:13:49,914
Yeah.

160
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:51,627
Yeah? Okay.

161
00:13:58,234 --> 00:14:00,299
All right.
What do you want?

162
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,991
All right, look.

163
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:29,620
So I make it 10 to 9, which means...

164
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,081
Shut up.

165
00:14:35,004 --> 00:14:37,114
Which means we need

166
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:39,150
to start a cook
in the next 10 minutes

167
00:14:39,275 --> 00:14:40,631
to keep to our schedule...

168
00:14:41,144 --> 00:14:43,634
Gus' schedule.

169
00:14:45,315 --> 00:14:47,388
And as angry as he may be,

170
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,474
I don't believe he's willing
to forfeit an entire batch.

171
00:14:50,855 --> 00:14:53,023
That just might make him angrier.

172
00:14:56,393 --> 00:14:58,938
Come on, Mike. Let us cook.

173
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:02,069
Isn't that what this
whole thing is about?

174
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,935
That's right, genius.
Watch me.

175
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,229
We ain't missing no cook.

176
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:45,263
We're closed!

177
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,217
Closed!

178
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,649
Saul Goodman and Associates.

179
00:17:29,774 --> 00:17:32,342
I'll see if he's in.
Please hold.

180
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:37,447
Saul, Skyler White calling.

181
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,437
Saul.

182
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,954
Saul, Skyler White on the line.

183
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,915
Saul!

184
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:04,418
Skyler White.

185
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,462
What the hell does she want?

186
00:18:14,117 --> 00:18:15,861
Uh, h-he's nowhere to be found.

187
00:18:15,986 --> 00:18:18,696
I called his condo.
I called every number I have for him.

188
00:18:18,821 --> 00:18:20,142
<i>Yeah, I'm sure he's fine.</i>

189
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,966
You're sure?

190
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,688
As in you know where he is?

191
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,437
Well, I'm not the man's keeper,

192
00:18:26,562 --> 00:18:28,109
but, uh, Walt's a big boy.

193
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,459
He'll turn up.

194
00:18:29,584 --> 00:18:31,487
<i>Mr. Goodman, clearly
something is going on here.</i>

195
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:34,323
I mean, why would he leave
his car in my driveway?

196
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,713
People carpool to work, right?
It's good for the environment.

197
00:18:37,838 --> 00:18:38,953
<i>He carpools?</i>

198
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,550
He carpools to his job at a meth lab?

199
00:18:41,675 --> 00:18:44,453
Hey, whoa! Ho ho!
You're breaking up there.

200
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,253
I didn't quite catch
that last... Whoo!

201
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:48,591
<i>You're a chatty Cathy today.</i>

202
00:18:48,716 --> 00:18:50,840
Okay, do you know anything?

203
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,295
Anything at all?

204
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,385
I'm looking for some help here.

205
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:56,933
<i>Look, Walter is fine, okay?</i>

206
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,932
I guarantee that 100%.

207
00:19:00,962 --> 00:19:03,352
100%.

208
00:19:08,102 --> 00:19:10,109
You got a passport, right?

209
00:19:52,413 --> 00:19:54,320
Yeah. Uh, Albuquerque.

210
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:56,626
I'm in, uh, Nob Hill.

211
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:59,492
I need the number for a locksmith.

212
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:02,077
I don't know. Pick one.

213
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,701
- You sure there's nothing?
- No, it's not even me.

214
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:07,003
It's state law, really.

215
00:20:07,128 --> 00:20:08,918
Are you sure there isn't
some sort of,

216
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:11,626
- I don't know, um...
- No. Nothing.

217
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:15,132
Maybe, uh, a car registration.
That would have your address.

218
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:18,469
No, but I can't even get in my car.
My car keys were on the same ring.

219
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,806
My God, my... My...
My credit cards, my...

220
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:23,220
It's all right, sweetheart.

221
00:20:23,345 --> 00:20:27,103
My driver's license, my checkbook.
I have to start canceling all that...

222
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:28,525
My whole life was in that purse,

223
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,360
and he just came,
and he cut it right off my shoulder.

224
00:20:31,485 --> 00:20:33,359
We could have been stabbed.

225
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:34,830
I'm sorry, really.

226
00:20:34,955 --> 00:20:37,466
But without proof of residency...

227
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:39,281
I can take you down to my shop.

228
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,243
You're welcome to wait there,
file a police report.

229
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,873
I can't believe this.

230
00:20:43,998 --> 00:20:45,746
I cannot believe this day.

231
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,210
I know. It's just...

232
00:20:47,335 --> 00:20:48,666
the law.

233
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:50,543
Oh, my God.

234
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,639
My identification.
I... It's gone.

235
00:20:55,576 --> 00:20:57,383
Oh, God, not...

236
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:59,322
Not this second.
Call the pharmacy. I...

237
00:20:59,447 --> 00:21:01,137
Are you okay?

238
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,192
Please, just...
Please, just take her.

239
00:21:03,317 --> 00:21:04,932
Just take her, please.

240
00:21:05,953 --> 00:21:08,397
Oh. Oh, God.

241
00:21:08,522 --> 00:21:09,822
Not now.

242
00:21:11,825 --> 00:21:14,358
No. No. No.

243
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:22,783
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
Truly.

244
00:21:23,304 --> 00:21:24,547
Here you go, sweetheart.

245
00:21:24,672 --> 00:21:26,370
Oh, there you go.

246
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:31,822
Um, how do you, um,

247
00:21:31,947 --> 00:21:33,690
how do you want to deal
with the bill?

248
00:21:33,815 --> 00:21:37,920
I... Unfortunately, all
my cash was taken, so...

249
00:21:38,045 --> 00:21:39,663
That's fine.
We'll mail it to you.

250
00:21:39,788 --> 00:21:42,733
Will you? You do know
where I live, right?

251
00:21:42,858 --> 00:21:45,737
Sir, again, thank you so much.

252
00:21:45,862 --> 00:21:47,141
Really.
Yeah.

253
00:23:34,771 --> 00:23:37,206
Hey, there! I'm back!

254
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,967
How was P.T.?

255
00:23:47,018 --> 00:23:51,231
I heard it was very good.

256
00:23:51,356 --> 00:23:52,366
Yeah.

257
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:55,102
I'm really liking this new therapist.

258
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:58,773
He keeps me in the loop,
always has time for a phone call.

259
00:23:58,898 --> 00:24:00,865
I just... I like it.

260
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:04,512
So...

261
00:24:04,637 --> 00:24:06,915
tell me all about it.

262
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,574
I heard you broke new ground today.

263
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,188
I broke new ground?

264
00:24:13,313 --> 00:24:14,872
That's what he said.

265
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:15,981
Tell me.

266
00:24:20,052 --> 00:24:23,197
I walked 16 feet in 20 minutes,

267
00:24:23,322 --> 00:24:27,176
which is up from my 15 1/2 yesterday.

268
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:29,386
And I had maybe this much
less shit in my pants,

269
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:31,176
so yeah, Marie, if you and him

270
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:34,139
and everybody else in America
secretly took a vote

271
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,912
and changed the meaning of
the entire English language,

272
00:24:37,037 --> 00:24:39,705
yeah, I guess I broke new ground.

273
00:24:41,442 --> 00:24:43,787
Well, call it a figure of speech,

274
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:47,882
but I am seeing progress.

275
00:24:51,287 --> 00:24:53,088
Definite progress.

276
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:56,747
You're ordering a new rock?

277
00:24:57,827 --> 00:24:59,542
I'm bidding on a new mineral.

278
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:03,664
It's a nice one.

279
00:25:08,336 --> 00:25:09,836
What? It's pretty.

280
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,314
I need the thing.

281
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:14,016
Okay.

282
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:15,950
<i>Numero uno?</i>

283
00:25:16,075 --> 00:25:17,509
<i>Dos.</i>

284
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:28,028
Okay.

285
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:55,088
Those...

286
00:25:55,213 --> 00:25:58,482
Those pretty little crystals.
I like that.

287
00:26:00,285 --> 00:26:00,936
Okay.

288
00:26:23,368 --> 00:26:25,678
All right, I just
want to go on record

289
00:26:25,803 --> 00:26:28,004
we should all be wearing masks.

290
00:26:35,946 --> 00:26:38,099
We should be wearing masks.

291
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,367
I bet he forgets the aluminum.

292
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:02,081
Guaranteed.

293
00:27:02,408 --> 00:27:04,500
Guarantee he forgets.

294
00:27:10,082 --> 00:27:11,425
Oh, you don't know

295
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,175
what the hell you're doing, do you?

296
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:15,386
You forgot the aluminum.

297
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,225
One of the first steps in the...

298
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:29,034
Son of a bitch.

299
00:29:17,781 --> 00:29:19,844
All right, let's talk
about Gale Boetticher.

300
00:29:21,485 --> 00:29:23,597
He was a good man and a good chemist,

301
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:25,054
and I cared about him.

302
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:30,236
He didn't deserve
what happened to him.

303
00:29:30,361 --> 00:29:32,295
He didn't deserve it at all.

304
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:37,576
But I'd shoot him again tomorrow

305
00:29:37,701 --> 00:29:40,880
and the next day
and the day after that.

306
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:43,849
When you make it Gale versus me

307
00:29:43,974 --> 00:29:45,953
or Gale versus Jesse,

308
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:49,078
Gale loses, simple as that.

309
00:29:54,383 --> 00:29:55,859
This is on you, Gus...

310
00:29:55,984 --> 00:29:57,214
Not me, not Jesse.

311
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,620
Gale's death is on you.

312
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,902
I mean, really, what did
you expect me to do,

313
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:06,474
just simply roll over

314
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:09,268
and allow you to murder us?

315
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:11,676
That I wouldn't take measures...

316
00:30:11,801 --> 00:30:14,145
Extreme measures to defend myself?

317
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,232
Wrong!

318
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:18,068
Think again.

319
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:19,418
And whatever...

320
00:30:19,543 --> 00:30:21,721
Whatever it is you're planning there,

321
00:30:21,846 --> 00:30:23,757
whatever...
Whatever it is...

322
00:30:23,882 --> 00:30:25,409
The point that you're trying
to make here,

323
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:27,787
let me... Let me suggest that
you keep one thing in mind.

324
00:30:29,822 --> 00:30:31,582
Without us,

325
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:33,584
without Jesse and myself,

326
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:37,755
you have no one to make your product.

327
00:30:39,066 --> 00:30:41,884
Certainly not him.

328
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,762
This... This person doesn't know
what the hell he's doing!

329
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:46,430
Been watching him for weeks.

330
00:30:47,074 --> 00:30:48,808
I know every step of his cook.

331
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:53,513
Do you really? You...

332
00:30:58,651 --> 00:31:02,696
Really? Oh, so please tell me.

333
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:04,467
Catalytic hydrogenation,

334
00:31:04,592 --> 00:31:07,370
is it protic or aprotic?
Because I forget.

335
00:31:07,495 --> 00:31:09,972
And if our reduction
is not stereospecific,

336
00:31:10,097 --> 00:31:13,290
then how can our product
be enantiomerically pure?

337
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:16,479
I mean, is 1 phenyl, 1 hyrdoxyl,

338
00:31:16,604 --> 00:31:18,047
2 methylaminopropane...

339
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:21,048
containing, of course, chiral centers

340
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:23,486
at carbons number 1 and 2
on the propane chain?

341
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:25,889
Then reduction to methamphetamine

342
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:29,392
eliminates which
chiral center is it again?

343
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:31,728
Because I forgot.

344
00:31:31,853 --> 00:31:35,438
Come on, help me out, professor!

345
00:31:35,604 --> 00:31:36,757
Gus.

346
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:39,202
We're here. Come on.

347
00:31:39,327 --> 00:31:41,110
Let us work.

348
00:31:41,596 --> 00:31:45,508
All his bullshit aside,
it's called a cook.

349
00:31:45,633 --> 00:31:47,908
See, everything comes down
to following a recipe.

350
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:50,578
Simple, complicated,
it doesn't matter.

351
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,982
The steps never change,

352
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:55,833
and I know every step.

353
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,377
Oh, is...
Is that what you want?

354
00:31:58,543 --> 00:32:02,173
This... This...
short order cook?

355
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:04,694
You're not flipping
hamburgers here, pal.

356
00:32:04,819 --> 00:32:06,927
What happens when you get a
bad barrel of precursor?

357
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:08,637
Or how would you even know it?

358
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:10,400
And what happens in the summer

359
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:12,933
when... When... When
the humidity rises

360
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:15,269
and your product goes cloudy?

361
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,631
H-How would you guard against that?

362
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:20,767
Gus.

363
00:32:22,303 --> 00:32:24,247
You do this,

364
00:32:24,372 --> 00:32:26,197
all you'll have left

365
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:29,575
is an $8 million hole in the ground.

366
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,011
This lab...

367
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:34,424
This equipment is useless without us.

368
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:36,792
Without... Without Jesse and myself,

369
00:32:36,917 --> 00:32:38,928
you have no new product.

370
00:32:39,053 --> 00:32:40,878
You... You...
You have no income.

371
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:42,998
Your people out there
will not be paid.

372
00:32:43,123 --> 00:32:45,501
Your distribution chain collapses.

373
00:32:45,626 --> 00:32:47,469
Without us...

374
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:49,494
you have nothing.

375
00:32:51,864 --> 00:32:54,600
You kill me, you have nothing.

376
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:57,937
You kill Jesse, you don't have me.

377
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:14,161
You won't do this.

378
00:33:15,456 --> 00:33:17,023
You're too smart.

379
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,209
You can't afford to do this.

380
00:33:21,662 --> 00:33:22,762
Please.

381
00:33:25,466 --> 00:33:27,675
Let us just go back to work.

382
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:29,235
We're here.

383
00:33:30,537 --> 00:33:33,472
Let us work.
We're ready to go to work.

384
00:33:34,707 --> 00:33:37,059
We'll just pick up
right where we left off.

385
00:33:56,786 --> 00:33:58,365
Oh, my God.

386
00:37:09,591 --> 00:37:10,523
Well?

387
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:14,828
Get back to work.

388
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,901
Let's just...
We'll just lay this down.

389
00:38:16,026 --> 00:38:18,340
We'll put him in feet first.

390
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:20,071
Grab his shoe.

391
00:38:20,196 --> 00:38:22,874
Oh. Here. Wait, wait.
Just life him up.

392
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:25,014
There. All right.

393
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,101
Here we go.

394
00:38:29,851 --> 00:38:30,982
God.

395
00:38:31,107 --> 00:38:33,142
If you push that way,
I'll hold him in.

396
00:38:35,378 --> 00:38:36,859
Okay, ready?

397
00:38:37,025 --> 00:38:38,903
1...

398
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:40,248
Oh, shit!

399
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:43,719
All right, wait. Wait.

400
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:47,495
Forget that.

401
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,211
Come on.

402
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,336
Up!

403
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:05,443
Get down.

404
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:08,812
Okay.

405
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,826
I never used this stuff.
You sure it'll do the job?

406
00:39:26,992 --> 00:39:29,245
Trust us.

407
00:40:58,423 --> 00:41:01,003
Here you go, hon.
Get you anything else?

408
00:41:01,169 --> 00:41:02,559
Uh, no, I'm good.
Thanks.

409
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,300
God.

410
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:33,160
How are you doing?

411
00:41:36,624 --> 00:41:37,957
No, I mean, you know...

412
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:42,095
How are you doing?

413
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:52,114
You did the only thing
that you could.

414
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:54,098
I hope you understand that.

415
00:41:57,642 --> 00:41:58,944
Thoughts?

416
00:42:02,416 --> 00:42:04,026
Got any thoughts

417
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:07,195
on what our next move might be?

418
00:42:07,777 --> 00:42:09,264
What next move?

419
00:42:09,389 --> 00:42:10,990
Our next move.

420
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:13,235
Our next move,

421
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,638
given the fact that
at the first opportunity

422
00:42:15,763 --> 00:42:17,455
Gus will kill us.

423
00:42:17,621 --> 00:42:20,749
What, that wasn't
an opportunity just now?

424
00:42:20,915 --> 00:42:23,612
Seemed like a pretty damn
good opportunity to me.

425
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,581
No, no.
Golden, I would say.

426
00:42:25,706 --> 00:42:27,283
We bought ourselves some time.

427
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:29,008
Uh-uh.
Yes, but...

428
00:42:30,343 --> 00:42:32,320
The question is how much.

429
00:42:32,445 --> 00:42:34,472
He'll be looking for another chemist.

430
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:36,648
He's not going to find
another chemist.

431
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:40,094
Where is he going to find
another chemist?

432
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:42,363
It's not just about somebody

433
00:42:42,488 --> 00:42:44,498
being able to run a lab that big.

434
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:46,266
Someone he can trust,

435
00:42:46,391 --> 00:42:49,561
someone he knows will
keep their mouths shut.

436
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:53,431
Yeah. Good luck with that.

437
00:42:55,468 --> 00:42:58,412
Bet it took him years to find Gale.

438
00:43:00,273 --> 00:43:01,791
Bet he's sorry now.

439
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,259
Are you sure you're okay?

440
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:14,527
At least now we all
understand each other.

441
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:16,896
Right?

442
00:43:17,021 --> 00:43:18,077
What do you mean?

443
00:43:18,515 --> 00:43:21,852
I mean him and us, we get it.

444
00:43:28,867 --> 00:43:31,102
We're all on the same page.

445
00:43:34,874 --> 00:43:37,284
What page is that?

446
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:39,888
The one that says...

447
00:43:40,013 --> 00:43:41,890
if I can't kill you,

448
00:43:42,015 --> 00:43:44,884
you'll shit wish you were dead.

449
00:43:56,528 --> 00:43:58,496
Yo. Excuse me.

450
00:44:00,932 --> 00:44:02,184
Thanks.

451
00:44:16,314 --> 00:44:17,314
Here.

452
00:44:19,651 --> 00:44:20,751
Thanks.

453
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,574
Hi.

454
00:44:44,445 --> 00:44:45,645
Hi.

455
00:44:47,548 --> 00:44:49,982
Um, it's... It's parked
over on Amsden.

456
00:44:50,148 --> 00:44:51,528
Junior was about to get up,

457
00:44:51,653 --> 00:44:53,110
and he would have seen it,

458
00:44:53,422 --> 00:44:55,991
so I wanted to avoid
a lot of questions.

459
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,366
That was smart.

460
00:44:59,532 --> 00:45:01,197
Yeah.

461
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,663
Kenny Rogers.

462
00:45:10,973 --> 00:45:12,254
You okay?

463
00:45:14,342 --> 00:45:15,633
Yeah.

464
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:17,802
Right as rain.

465
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:27,186
Do you have your keys?

466
00:45:27,352 --> 00:45:28,665
Yeah.

467
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:31,702
Uh, it's parked three blocks down

468
00:45:31,827 --> 00:45:33,194
on the right.

469
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:36,932
Yeah.

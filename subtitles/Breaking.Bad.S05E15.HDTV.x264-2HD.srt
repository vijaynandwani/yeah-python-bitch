00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:14,593
I hate to be a downer here,

166
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:16,729
but there are two
DEA agents missing.

167
00:10:16,763 --> 00:10:17,963
Presumed dead.

168
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:19,815
You think the feds
are gonna just let that go

169
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:21,183
'cause you hit
the ejector seat?

170
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:22,651
First thing they're gonna do,

171
00:10:22,686 --> 00:10:25,637
they will RICO your wife
and kids out of the house.

172
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:27,656
That condo is gone.

173
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:29,491
Your bank accounts,
they're frozen.

174
00:10:29,526 --> 00:10:31,476
Her picture's probably
on TV right now,

175
00:10:31,494 --> 00:10:32,528
next to yours.

176
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:33,946
Who's gonna hire her?

177
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,080
Money's no problem.

178
00:10:35,115 --> 00:10:37,249
Well, I don't mean
to contradict you,

179
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:39,585
but getting it to her,
impossible.

180
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:42,338
The feds are just praying
that you'll make contact.

181
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:44,506
Internet, the phone--
it's all tapped.

182
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,209
Hey, Mike was no dummy.

183
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,262
But every time he tried to get his
nest egg to his granddaughter,

184
00:10:50,297 --> 00:10:54,350
it ended up
in Uncle Sam's pockets.

185
00:10:54,384 --> 00:10:56,885
So you propose what?

186
00:10:58,305 --> 00:11:01,273
Stay. Face the music.

187
00:11:01,308 --> 00:11:05,344
Hey, I mean, how much time
have you got left?

188
00:11:05,362 --> 00:11:07,396
You walk in with
your head held high.

189
00:11:07,447 --> 00:11:08,847
You'll be the John Dillinger

190
00:11:08,865 --> 00:11:10,349
of the Metropolitan
Detention Center.

191
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:11,516
How bad is that?

192
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:13,319
And you bring a barrel
full of drug money,

193
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:16,288
maybe that soothes
some troubled waters.

194
00:11:16,323 --> 00:11:18,657
Maybe they let your family
stay in the house.

195
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:22,294
After all, the house predates
the criminal enterprise.

196
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:24,363
God, you think I want to run?!

197
00:11:24,381 --> 00:11:27,333
This is the last thing
that I want.

198
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,468
This-- this changes nothing.

199
00:11:29,502 --> 00:11:33,038
What I do, I do for my family.

200
00:11:33,056 --> 00:11:35,474
My money goes to my children.

201
00:11:35,508 --> 00:11:37,542
Not just this barrel.
All of it!

202
00:11:39,896 --> 00:11:43,349
I'm going to kill Jack
and his entire crew,

203
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:45,818
and I'm gonna
take back what is mine

204
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:47,353
and give it to my children.

205
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:50,489
And then, and only then...

206
00:11:50,523 --> 00:11:52,157
Am I through.

207
00:11:52,192 --> 00:11:54,410
Do you understand?

208
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,198
Everything good?

209
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:01,116
Define "good."

210
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:04,203
You're set.
Time to go.

211
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:06,588
You'll be a little longer.

212
00:12:06,623 --> 00:12:08,590
I'm still working
on transportation.

213

Change of plans.

214
00:12:10,377 --> 00:12:11,593
He's coming with me.

215
00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:13,912
No.
No, that's not--

216
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:18,467
We're going together.
I can use him.

217
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:20,886
I'll give you two a minute.

218
00:12:21,888 --> 00:12:23,772
Hey, I'm a civilian.

219
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:25,107
I'm not your lawyer anymore.

220
00:12:25,141 --> 00:12:27,309
I'm nobody's lawyer.
The fun's over.

221

From here on out,
I'm Mr. Low Profile.

Whether you like it or not.

I'm sorry.
I don't think so.

what's happening here?

Yes.

00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:17,300

I understand
I'm in terrible trouble.

I give you Walt.

I can't give you what you want.

What about your son?

am I gonna see him?

There's just something
that we gotta straighten out.

Okay? We know that you've
been talking to the police,

You sure about that?

00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:12,054
I didn't.

to know anything about her.

have to say the name.

You're not Western Union, Todd.

We can't just settle
for you sending messages.

a problem with her.

Tested it twice.

329
00:20:45,602 --> 00:20:49,087
And it's blue.
Just like before.

330

That's Heisenberg level.

Well, next best thing.
Pinkman.

333
00:21:00,984 --> 00:21:03,768
They're looking for Pinkman.

334

Well, they're not
going to find him.

He's with us,
and he's not going anywhere.

336

Ms. Quayle, this is what
your guys in Europe

I just think we work together... good.

We make a good team.

340
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:36,768
I think it's kind of...

341
00:21:36,802 --> 00:21:39,771

Mr. Lambert,
welcome to New Hampshire.

346
00:22:40,774 --> 00:22:42,641
All right.

347
00:22:42,692 --> 00:22:45,260
Let's have a look
at this place.

348
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:48,764
You got about a month's
worth of food on hand,

349
00:22:48,782 --> 00:22:50,616
most of it's canned goods,

350
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,985
but there's steaks
in the freezer.

351
00:22:53,036 --> 00:22:55,120
You got a generator outside,

352
00:22:55,155 --> 00:22:56,538
works on LP.

353
00:22:56,573 --> 00:22:58,540
Ought to be enough in the tank

354
00:22:58,575 --> 00:22:59,775
to last out the winter.

355
00:22:59,793 --> 00:23:01,210
It's only 15 amps,

356
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:02,962
but that ought to do
for the lights,

357
00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:04,797
TV, and the freezer.

358
00:23:04,831 --> 00:23:06,799
That's a wood-burner.

359
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,284
Ought to warm
the place up pretty good.

360
00:23:09,302 --> 00:23:12,137
Plus you can cook on it.

361
00:23:12,172 --> 00:23:13,923
On the TV front,

362
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:16,225
the reception's
pretty much nil.

363
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:17,977
You got some mountains
in the way.

364
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:21,296
Weather's right, you might
be able to catch Montreal,

365
00:23:21,314 --> 00:23:24,299
but mostly you'll be
limited to DVDs.

I'm not much of a movie guy.

369

$50,000 for a trip to Costco.

373
00:23:47,424 --> 00:23:48,757
It's risk.

374
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:51,210
And risk is what
you're paying me for,

375
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:52,845
not toilet paper.

376

Mr. Lambert,
my clients and I

378

don't usually have
an ongoing relationship.

Normally, you and I would have
already gone our separate ways,

380

No phone.

Your business is your business.

My business is keeping
you out of custody.

You are the target
of a nation-wide manhunt.

Your face is all over TV.

you've got to keep
out of sight.

401

And what's keeping me
from walking out that gate?

Nothing.

eight miles down the hill.

405

There's not a thing

that I can do to stop you
going down there.

All I'm saying is,

00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:23,385
if you leave this place,

409
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:26,138
you will get caught.

if I find out that
you've left the reservation,

00:35:09,939 --> 00:35:12,607
Settle down.

494
00:35:12,642 --> 00:35:14,509
Hey, remember.

495
00:35:14,527 --> 00:35:16,695
There's still the kid.

496
00:36:17,557 --> 00:36:20,058
I brought you a couple
of cases of ensure.

497
00:36:20,076 --> 00:36:21,660
Maybe put a little
weight on you.

498
00:36:21,694 --> 00:36:23,162
Jesus.

499
00:36:23,196 --> 00:36:25,197
I can barely read this.

500
00:36:25,231 --> 00:36:27,332
Ah. Almost forgot.

501
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:29,234
Without a prescription,

502
00:36:29,252 --> 00:36:31,203
I had to take an educated
guess and shotgun it.

503
00:36:31,237 --> 00:36:32,671
One of these
ought to come close.

504
00:36:32,705 --> 00:36:34,706
Oh.

505
00:36:37,177 --> 00:36:39,094
Did you, uh, check on them?

506
00:36:39,129 --> 00:36:41,079
Is Skyler in a better place?

507
00:36:41,097 --> 00:36:44,466
Nah, she's still at that
place off of Eubank.

508
00:36:44,517 --> 00:36:46,852
Kids are both still
with her for the moment.

509
00:36:46,886 --> 00:36:49,471
Uh, there's no court date yet.

510
00:36:49,522 --> 00:36:52,024
The news was talking
about a grand jury,

511
00:36:52,058 --> 00:36:54,259
but they didn't say when.

512
00:36:54,277 --> 00:36:57,613
I saw her
public defender on TV.

513
00:36:57,647 --> 00:37:00,265
Looks like a deer
in the headlights.

514
00:37:00,283 --> 00:37:04,870
Think I got socks
older than him.

515
00:37:04,904 --> 00:37:07,489
What are they doing for money?

516
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,292
She's doing
taxi dispatch part-time.

517
00:37:10,326 --> 00:37:14,463
Leaves the baby with a
neighbor when she goes in.

518
00:37:14,497 --> 00:37:16,498
I saw her shopping one time.

519
00:37:16,549 --> 00:37:18,217
She looks pretty good.

520
00:37:18,251 --> 00:37:20,836
And she's using
her maiden name.

521
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:23,222
I wouldn't take that personally

522
00:37:23,256 --> 00:37:24,840
under the circumstances.

523
00:37:24,891 --> 00:37:26,475

524
00:37:26,509 --> 00:37:28,793
Oh, yeah.

525
00:37:28,812 --> 00:37:31,180
I took a run by your old house.

526
00:37:31,231 --> 00:37:33,148
Uh, the auction's
still pending.

527
00:37:33,183 --> 00:37:35,234
They put a fence up around it.

528
00:37:35,268 --> 00:37:36,485
They put up a fence?

529
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:37,636
Seems like the place

530
00:37:37,654 --> 00:37:39,738
got to be kind of
a tourist attraction.

531
00:37:39,772 --> 00:37:41,356
Kids breaking in.

532
00:37:41,407 --> 00:37:42,474
The neighbors complained,

533
00:37:42,492 --> 00:37:44,976
so the bank put up a fence.

534
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:51,250
You ready?

535
00:37:51,284 --> 00:37:53,418
Hmm?

536
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:58,423
Yeah.

537
00:38:01,261 --> 00:38:04,162
Sorry about last time.

538
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,298
It should go better now.

539
00:38:06,332 --> 00:38:10,168
I watched a couple
of YouTube videos.

540
00:38:10,186 --> 00:38:13,522
It's all about
finding the vein.

541
00:38:13,556 --> 00:38:17,142
Give it to me.
I'll do it.

That's it. Okay. Hey.

encumbered.

I'll be dead.

to give it to my family?

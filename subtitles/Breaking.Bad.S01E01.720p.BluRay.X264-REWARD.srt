1
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:16,427
My name is
Walter Hartwell White.

2
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:19,492
I live at
308 Negra Arroyo Lane,

3
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,118
Albuquerque, New Mexico,
87104.

4
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:25,584
To all law enforcement entitles,
this is not an admission of guilt.

5
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:28,384
I am speaking
to my family now.

6
00:02:35,703 --> 00:02:36,791
Skyler...

7
00:02:37,768 --> 00:02:39,463
you are the love
of my life.

8
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:41,645
I hope you know that.

9
00:02:43,406 --> 00:02:44,891
Walter, Junior...

10
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:47,007
you're my big man.

11
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:49,346
There are...

12
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,419
There are going
to be some...

13
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:53,460
things... things...

14
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:57,291
that you'll come to learn
about me in the next few days.

15
00:02:57,316 --> 00:02:59,339
I just want you to know

16
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:02,315
that no... no matter
how it may look,

17
00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:04,866
I only had you in my heart.

18
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:12,614
Good-bye.

19
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:51,272
"Pilot"

20
00:05:16,436 --> 00:05:17,899
Happy Birthday.

21
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:21,540
Look at that.

22
00:05:22,471 --> 00:05:24,485
That is veggie bacon.

23
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,043
Believe it or not.
Zero cholesterol.

24
00:05:27,045 --> 00:05:29,446
You won't even taste
the difference.

25
00:05:30,626 --> 00:05:32,280
What time do you think
you'll be home?

26
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:33,348
Same time.

27
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,703
I don't want him dicking
you around tonight.

28
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:38,881
You get paid till 5,
you work till 5, no later.

29
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:41,904
Hey.

30
00:05:43,336 --> 00:05:45,231
- Happy Birthday.
- Well, thank you.

31
00:05:45,274 --> 00:05:47,219
You're late... again.

32
00:05:47,402 --> 00:05:50,222
There was no
hot water... again.

33
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:52,045
I have an easy fix
for that.

34
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:53,651
You wake up early,

35
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:56,676
and then you get to be
the first person in the shower.

36
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:58,318
I have an idea.

37
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:04,057
How about buy
a new hot water heater?

38
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:05,505
How's that idea?

39
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:08,296
For the millionth
and billionth time.

40
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:13,552
- Did you take your Echinacea?
- Yeah.

41
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:15,427
I think it's getting better.

42
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,520
What the hell is this?

43
00:06:18,931 --> 00:06:22,500
It's veggie bacon.
We're watching our cholesterol, I guess.

44
00:06:22,537 --> 00:06:24,507
Not me.
I want real bacon.

45
00:06:24,573 --> 00:06:26,304
Not this fake crap.

46
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:27,459
Too bad.

47
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:28,608
Eat it.

48
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:32,908
This smells
like Band-aids.

49
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:35,012
Eat... it.

50
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,279
So, how's it feel
to be old?

51
00:06:42,637 --> 00:06:44,891
How does it feel
to be a smart ass?

52
00:06:45,191 --> 00:06:46,221
Good.

53
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:49,961
Eat your veggie bacon.

54
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:10,722
- You all set?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

55
00:07:10,738 --> 00:07:13,375
- All right, see you at home.
- Okay, see you.

56
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:18,774
Chemistry.

57
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,978
It is the study of what?

58
00:07:23,498 --> 00:07:24,543
Anyone?

59
00:07:26,384 --> 00:07:27,097
Ben.

60
00:07:27,786 --> 00:07:30,051
- Chemicals.
- Chemicals!

61
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:31,749
No!

62
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,887
Chemistry is...

63
00:07:35,782 --> 00:07:37,179
Well, technically,

64
00:07:37,454 --> 00:07:39,934
chemistry is
the study of matter.

65
00:07:40,998 --> 00:07:44,200
But I prefer to see it
as the study of change.

66
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:46,603
Now just...
just think about this.

67
00:07:46,903 --> 00:07:47,981
Electrons.

68
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:49,689
They...

69
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:52,492
change their energy levels.

70
00:07:52,498 --> 00:07:53,684
Molecules.

71
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:56,877
Molecules change
their bonds.

72
00:07:57,817 --> 00:07:58,906
Elements.

73
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,706
They combine
and change into compounds.

74
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,247
Well, that's...
that's all of life.

75
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:08,754
Right? I mean, it's just...
It's the constant.

76
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:11,276
It's the cycle.
It's solution,

77
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:14,265
dissolution, just over
and over and over.

78
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:18,295
It is growth, then decay,
then transformation.

79
00:08:21,763 --> 00:08:24,178
It is fascinating, really.

80
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:31,385
Chad...

81
00:08:33,277 --> 00:08:35,626
Is there something
wrong with your table?

82
00:08:38,277 --> 00:08:40,319
Okay.
Ionic bonds...

83
00:08:50,226 --> 00:08:51,391
Are you done?

84
00:08:54,151 --> 00:08:55,360
Ionic bonds.

85
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,977
Chapter 6.

86
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:12,721
And 2, 3 makes 10,
and 10 makes 20.

87
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:14,162
Here's your receipt,

88
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:16,545
and hand this claiming disc
to your car wash professional.

89
00:09:16,574 --> 00:09:18,351
Thank you.
Come again.

90
00:09:30,117 --> 00:09:31,281
He's not coming.

91
00:09:31,307 --> 00:09:32,762
He said he quits.

92
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,543
I'm gonna run
the register.

93
00:09:35,713 --> 00:09:38,157
Bogdan, no.
We talked about this.

94
00:09:38,232 --> 00:09:39,759
I'm shorthanded, Walter.

95
00:09:39,864 --> 00:09:41,163
What am I to do?

96
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,627
Walter?

97
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:48,010
What am I to do?

98
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,787
Hey, Mr. White!

99
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:14,262
Make those tires
shine, huh?

100
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:15,575
Oh, my God.

101
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:19,011
You would not believe
who's cleaning Chad's car.

102
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,392
Mr. White...

103
00:10:20,935 --> 00:10:22,188
from Chemistry.

104
00:10:41,913 --> 00:10:43,129
Surprise!

105
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:45,850
Happy Birthday, Dad!

106
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:52,060
You're so very late.

107
00:10:53,144 --> 00:10:55,129
Really, I'm serious,
Skyler.

108
00:10:55,385 --> 00:10:57,664
I mean, you're flat
as a washboard.

109
00:10:58,293 --> 00:10:59,829
You look awesome.

110
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,835
She's not showing
at all, is she?

111
00:11:01,847 --> 00:11:03,334
She's showing
a little.

112
00:11:04,901 --> 00:11:07,110
Carmen, this is
my sister Marie.

113
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,630
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.

114
00:11:10,951 --> 00:11:13,712
Glock 22.
It's my daily carry, okay?

115
00:11:13,935 --> 00:11:16,815
I mean, unless you're talking,
what, plus, B-plus loads,

116
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:18,739
you can forget
the 9-mil, all right?

117
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:22,719
I seen one of those
bounce off a windshield one time.

118
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:24,628
Yeah, the way you shoot.

119
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,768
If you're gonna
bring a gun,

120
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,464
you gotta bring
enough gun.

121
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:29,710
.40 caliber.

122
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:33,779
- This is awesome right here.
- Nice, isn't it?

123
00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:35,839
Dad, come check
this out.

124
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,095
- Yeah, I see it.
- Come on, take it.

125
00:11:38,428 --> 00:11:39,698
Check it out, Walt.

126
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:43,204
No, no,
it's just heavy.

127
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:45,023
That's why they hire men.

128
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,973
It's not gonna
bite you, all right?

129
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:51,737
Looks like Keith Richards
with a glass of warm milk, doesn't he?

130
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:55,500
Hey, Walt. Everybody listen up,
listen up, listen up!

131
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:56,794
I'm gonna give a toast.

132
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,317
A little toast to my brother-in-law.
Come here.

133
00:11:59,854 --> 00:12:03,406
Walt, you got a brain
the size of Wisconsin,

134
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:06,483
but we're not gonna
hold that against you.

135
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,711
Because your heart's
in the right place, man.

136
00:12:08,712 --> 00:12:10,160
Your heart's
in the right place.

137
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:11,611
We love you, man.
We love you.

138
00:12:11,612 --> 00:12:13,204
Everybody!
To Walt!

139
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:14,147
Na zdorovje!

140
00:12:14,162 --> 00:12:15,461
Na zdorovje!

141
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:20,790
Hey,
turn on Channel 3.

142
00:12:24,297 --> 00:12:26,308
At which point we apprehended
three individuals

143
00:12:26,323 --> 00:12:28,024
and placed them into custody.

144
00:12:28,251 --> 00:12:30,287
I'm proud to say
the outstanding

145
00:12:30,306 --> 00:12:32,374
professionalism
of my fellow agents

146
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,259
at the Albuquerque
District Office

147
00:12:34,334 --> 00:12:36,083
resulted in
a substantial amount

148
00:12:36,104 --> 00:12:38,521
of methamphetamine
being taken off the streets.

149
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:39,896
Were any shots fired?

150
00:12:39,944 --> 00:12:42,544
No, ma'am. Our agents took
the suspects by surprise.

151
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,201
Damn, the TV does
add ten pounds.

152
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:46,921
Ten pounds?

153
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,429
Hey, sit and spin.
Both of you.

154
00:12:49,454 --> 00:12:51,093
- Hank.
- What?

155
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:54,281
Sorry.
You didn't see that.

156
00:12:54,822 --> 00:12:56,034
So charming.

157
00:12:56,077 --> 00:12:58,146
This is clearly
an ongoing operation,

158
00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:00,377
one which was
well organized...

159
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:01,882
Hank, how much
money is that?

160
00:13:01,897 --> 00:13:04,234
It's about 700 grand.
That's a pretty good haul, huh?

161
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:07,398
As I say, it's a good day
for the citizens of Albuquerque

162
00:13:07,403 --> 00:13:10,390
when we can put this big a dent
in the local drug trade.

163
00:13:10,493 --> 00:13:13,622
But that's unusual,
isn't it, that kind of cash?

164
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:15,937
Well, it's not the most
we ever took.

165
00:13:15,973 --> 00:13:17,274
It's easy money...

166
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:18,924
until we catch you.

167
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,263
Walt, just say the word
and I'll take you on a ride-along.

168
00:13:22,311 --> 00:13:24,573
You can watch us
knock down a meth lab.

169
00:13:24,812 --> 00:13:26,732
Get a little excitement
in your life.

170
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:29,993
Well, someday.

171
00:13:39,336 --> 00:13:40,757
Which one's this?

172
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,795
That faux-Lalique vase

173
00:13:42,806 --> 00:13:44,819
I picked up
at the Super-Swap.

174
00:13:50,411 --> 00:13:51,579
How's it doing?

175
00:13:51,585 --> 00:13:53,119
I met my reserve,

176
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,205
and there's still
two minutes.

177
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:04,642
What's up?

178
00:14:05,465 --> 00:14:07,687
You tell me,
birthday boy.

179
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:12,682
Oh, hey, so what's up
for Saturday?

180
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,781
Car wash.

181
00:14:14,997 --> 00:14:16,435
Bogdan says
he needs me.

182
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:18,508
Until what time?
Noon? 1-ish?

183
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:20,406
Probably 2,
more like it.

184
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,981
And then what
after that?

185
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:26,110
Actually...

186
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:29,195
I was thinking
of driving

187
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,017
up to Los Alamos.

188
00:14:31,861 --> 00:14:34,117
The visitor center
has an exhibit on...

189
00:14:34,344 --> 00:14:35,805
It's really supposed
to be...

190
00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:38,336
- You're not gonna paint?
- I'll paint.

191
00:14:39,214 --> 00:14:41,055
It's just that this...

192
00:14:41,637 --> 00:14:43,806
part of this exhibition on the...

193
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:46,230
Mars Rover
photographs are...

194
00:14:47,258 --> 00:14:50,684
The detail really is just
supposed to be amazing.

195
00:14:50,712 --> 00:14:53,188
It's just that I really need you
to paint at some point.

196
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:56,378
I mean, the sooner that
back bedroom gets finished.

197
00:14:56,644 --> 00:14:59,235
And I'd do it myself, except
you said you don't want me

198
00:14:59,236 --> 00:15:02,244
- standing on the stepladder.
- I'll paint. I will paint.

199
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:07,536
What is going on
down there?

200
00:15:07,965 --> 00:15:10,265
- No, it's just...
- Is he asleep?

201
00:15:11,686 --> 00:15:14,133
No, It's nothing.
You know, just...

202
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,581
You know,

203
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:17,865
we gotta be careful
about the baby.

204
00:15:17,934 --> 00:15:20,871
Don't worry about the baby.
This is just for you.

205
00:15:21,017 --> 00:15:24,373
We are just
doing you tonight.

206
00:15:25,413 --> 00:15:27,413
So just close your eyes.

207
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,520
Relax, and let it...

208
00:15:35,558 --> 00:15:37,797
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

209
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:43,117
There you go.

210
00:15:43,747 --> 00:15:44,911
That's it.

211
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:46,982
That's it.

212
00:15:48,109 --> 00:15:49,840
There you go.

213
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:52,230
Keep it going.

214
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,487
Keep it going.

215
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,464
Keep it going.

216
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,257
Keep... Yes!

217
00:16:01,366 --> 00:16:02,597
56!

218
00:16:54,273 --> 00:16:55,755
This is so embarrassing.

219
00:16:55,777 --> 00:16:57,457
I am fine. Honestly.

220
00:16:58,332 --> 00:17:00,204
It's just some bug
going around.

221
00:17:00,281 --> 00:17:02,894
First my wife had it,
then my son, and now me.

222
00:17:03,714 --> 00:17:06,445
It's just like
a chest cold.

223
00:17:07,186 --> 00:17:09,208
Could be some
low blood sugar as well.

224
00:17:09,213 --> 00:17:12,206
I didn't have the greatest
breakfast this morning, honestly.

225
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:15,476
Hey, listen, can you do me a favor?
Can you just...

226
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:17,853
drop me off
at a corner somewhere?

227
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,598
No. Sorry.

228
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:24,236
It's just that I don't have
the greatest insurance.

229
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:26,492
Take a couple
of deep breaths for me.

230
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:35,278
Is there anybody you want us
to contact for you?

231
00:17:35,441 --> 00:17:36,560
God, no.

232
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,077
Lean forward for me,
would you?

233
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:44,051
Mr. White,
are you a smoker?

234
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,797
No. Never.

235
00:17:48,394 --> 00:17:49,722
Why do you ask?

236
00:18:30,424 --> 00:18:31,424
Mr. White.

237
00:18:33,317 --> 00:18:34,280
Mr. White?

238
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:36,950
Yes.

239
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,118
You understood what
I've just said to you?

240
00:18:41,438 --> 00:18:42,229
Yes.

241
00:18:42,903 --> 00:18:44,841
Lung cancer.
Inoperable.

242
00:18:47,408 --> 00:18:48,617
I'm sorry...

243
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,941
I just need to make sure
you fully understand.

244
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:55,035
Best-case scenario,
with chemo,

245
00:18:55,274 --> 00:18:57,766
I'll live maybe
another couple years.

246
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:01,430
It's just...

247
00:19:02,262 --> 00:19:04,859
you've got mustard
on your...

248
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:08,825
Right there.
Mustard, there.

249
00:19:09,224 --> 00:19:10,224
Right there.

250
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:22,959
So my records show
that I paid it,

251
00:19:22,965 --> 00:19:25,372
and I certainly don't
feel that we owe any late...

252
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,055
All right.

253
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:29,768
Well, I'll check
with the bank

254
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:31,590
and maybe the post office,

255
00:19:31,608 --> 00:19:33,389
if they lost it or something.

256
00:19:33,729 --> 00:19:35,472
Yeah, let me look
into that.

257
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:36,427
Okay.

258
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,023
Thank you.

259
00:19:46,828 --> 00:19:49,359
Did you use
the MasterCard last month?

260
00:19:50,237 --> 00:19:52,301
15.88 at Staples?

261
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,151
We needed printer paper.

262
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,168
Walt, the MasterCard's
the one we don't use.

263
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:07,304
Okay.

264
00:20:08,455 --> 00:20:10,956
So how was your day?

265
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,108
Oh, I don't know.

266
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,500
I don't know.
It was, um...

267
00:20:19,661 --> 00:20:21,093
It was fine.

268
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:56,730
Come on. I'm shorthanded.
I need you to do some wipe-downs.

269
00:20:56,804 --> 00:20:58,000
- Come on.
- What?

270
00:20:58,033 --> 00:21:00,272
I said I need you outside
to do some wipe-downs.

271
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:02,681
Are you here to work
or to be staring at the skies?

272
00:21:02,689 --> 00:21:04,148
Come on, let's go.

273
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:07,389
Come on, man.

274
00:21:08,328 --> 00:21:10,463
- Fuck you, Bogdan.
- What?

275
00:21:10,483 --> 00:21:12,344
I said fuck you!

276
00:21:12,548 --> 00:21:14,029
And your eyebrows!

277
00:21:18,057 --> 00:21:19,401
Wipe down this!

278
00:22:21,396 --> 00:22:22,486
Uh, Hank.

279
00:22:22,963 --> 00:22:24,628
Hank, it's Walt.
Hey.

280
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:27,347
Oh, listen...
I didn't wake you, did I?

281
00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:29,228
Oh, good, good.

282
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,932
No, no, nothing's wrong.
I just, uh...

283
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:36,782
I've been, uh, thinking
about that offer...

284
00:22:37,793 --> 00:22:39,151
that ride-along.

285
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,814
It's the last house
on the right. See it?

286
00:22:42,836 --> 00:22:44,640
Not the two-story one.
The one next to it.

287
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,659
The kind of... I don't know,
what do you call that?

288
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,476
- Green?
- Sage.

289
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:51,760
Sage.

290
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:54,418
What, do you work at
the fucking Pottery Barn?

291
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,504
Sage.
That's the word for it.

292
00:22:56,962 --> 00:22:59,753
My fault the only word
your dumb ass knows is green?

293
00:22:59,873 --> 00:23:00,997
Cheese dick.

294
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:03,170
I know that one.
How 'bout that?

295
00:23:03,713 --> 00:23:06,049
Anyway, it's the sage one.
See it?

296
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:09,877
So what tells you
it's a meth lab?

297
00:23:10,086 --> 00:23:12,699
Star snitch says
some dude

298
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:15,831
goes by Cap'n Cook
lives up to his name in there.

299
00:23:16,088 --> 00:23:19,144
Says he always adds
a dash of chili powder.

300
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,469
Ah, you exuberant
Mexicans.

301
00:23:23,337 --> 00:23:25,474
Captain Cook,
that's a white boy's name.

302
00:23:25,623 --> 00:23:26,921
Dopey as hell, too.

303
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:28,711
Yeah?
Tell you what.

304
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:31,594
I got 20 bucks that
says he's a beaner.

305
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,406
- All right.
- You're on.

306
00:23:35,646 --> 00:23:37,398
All right,
come on, come on.

307
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:44,503
All right. School bus is clear.
Got the green light.

308
00:23:44,543 --> 00:23:45,506
Copy that.

309
00:23:53,843 --> 00:23:56,075
Watch this.
This makes 'em shit.

310
00:24:00,046 --> 00:24:01,986
Go, go, go.

311
00:24:11,697 --> 00:24:13,286
Meth labs are nasty
on a good day.

312
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,682
You mix that wrong,
you got mustard gas.

313
00:24:15,957 --> 00:24:17,285
Phosphine gas.

314
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:19,614
I think.

315
00:24:19,816 --> 00:24:20,930
Yeah, exactly.

316
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:23,881
One whiff will kill you.
That's why the respirators.

317
00:25:12,749 --> 00:25:14,983
House is clear.
One suspect in custody.

318
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,314
Copy that.

319
00:25:16,477 --> 00:25:19,796
The suspect, might he be
of the Latino persuasion?

320
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,587
Driver's license says
Emilio Koyama.

321
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:23,988
Asian!

322
00:25:24,004 --> 00:25:25,243
Pay up, sucker.

323
00:25:25,683 --> 00:25:27,181
First name Emilio.

324
00:25:27,303 --> 00:25:29,075
That's at least half
a beaner.

325
00:25:29,118 --> 00:25:31,133
Tell you what,
I'll let you off for a 10.

326
00:25:33,452 --> 00:25:36,013
Cheer up, Gomey.
You people still got J. Lo.

327
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:39,662
Hank, do you think
I might get to go inside?

328
00:25:40,094 --> 00:25:41,520
See the actual lab?

329
00:25:45,948 --> 00:25:47,351
Yeah. Yeah,
I tell you what,

330
00:25:47,356 --> 00:25:49,127
we're gonna go
peek our heads in,

331
00:25:49,205 --> 00:25:50,775
check it out first.

332
00:25:51,402 --> 00:25:52,969
Stay here a minute.

333
00:26:25,457 --> 00:26:26,352
God.

334
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:34,838
Oh, my God.

335
00:26:37,057 --> 00:26:38,001
Pinkman?

336
00:27:35,624 --> 00:27:36,687
It's me.

337
00:27:36,936 --> 00:27:38,091
I'm alone.

338
00:27:44,564 --> 00:27:46,164
How'd you find me?

339
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,784
You're still
in our filing system.

340
00:27:51,551 --> 00:27:54,327
So your aunt
owns this place, right?

341
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:56,251
I own it.

342
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,405
No one's looking for you.

343
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:03,017
Why are you here?

344
00:28:03,271 --> 00:28:05,092
I was curious.

345
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,651
Honestly,
I never expected you

346
00:28:07,654 --> 00:28:10,480
to amount to much,
but methamphetamine?

347
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,866
I didn't picture that.

348
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:18,363
There's a lot of money
in it, huh?

349
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,121
I don't know what
you're talking about.

350
00:28:20,137 --> 00:28:21,953
- No?
- Not a clue.

351
00:28:25,095 --> 00:28:26,259
Cap'n Cook?

352
00:28:27,367 --> 00:28:28,755
That's not you?

353
00:28:34,961 --> 00:28:37,027
Like I said,
no one is looking for you.

354
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:40,868
Look, I don't know what you think
you're doing here, Mr. White.

355
00:28:41,171 --> 00:28:44,299
I mean, if you're planning
on giving me some bowl winder

356
00:28:44,303 --> 00:28:47,252
about getting right with Jesus
by turning myself in...

357
00:28:47,262 --> 00:28:49,981
- Not really.
- High school was a long time ago.

358
00:28:50,088 --> 00:28:52,922
You ain't Welcome Back Kotter,
so step off.

359
00:28:53,037 --> 00:28:54,380
No speeches.

360
00:28:54,842 --> 00:28:56,058
Short speech.

361
00:28:57,008 --> 00:28:59,798
You lost your partner today.
What's his name?

362
00:29:01,126 --> 00:29:02,141
Emilio?

363
00:29:03,647 --> 00:29:05,647
Emilio is going to prison.

364
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:10,640
The DEA took all your money,
your lab.

365
00:29:12,325 --> 00:29:13,683
You got nothing.

366
00:29:13,951 --> 00:29:15,190
Square 1.

367
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:18,378
But you know
the business.

368
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:21,358
And I know the chemistry.

369
00:29:24,938 --> 00:29:26,303
I'm thinking...

370
00:29:27,112 --> 00:29:29,306
maybe you and I
could partner up.

371
00:29:43,107 --> 00:29:45,368
You want to cook crystal meth?

372
00:29:46,736 --> 00:29:47,676
You?

373
00:29:48,277 --> 00:29:50,829
You and, uh... and me?

374
00:29:51,796 --> 00:29:53,050
That's right.

375
00:29:56,219 --> 00:29:57,473
Either that...

376
00:29:58,418 --> 00:29:59,925
or I turn you in.

377
00:30:11,483 --> 00:30:12,812
What the hell is this?

378
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:14,132
Damned if I know.

379
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:16,416
I described it
as mosaic folk art.

380
00:30:16,485 --> 00:30:18,908
- Somebody bought it?
- Yeah, some guy in Minneapolis.

381
00:30:18,912 --> 00:30:20,459
$14.00 plus shipping.

382
00:30:20,482 --> 00:30:21,254
Yes!

383
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:24,573
At this rate, in 50 or 60 years,
you'll be rich.

384
00:30:25,582 --> 00:30:27,148
So how goes the novel?

385
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:29,522
It's not a novel,
actually, which I have...

386
00:30:29,525 --> 00:30:32,226
You're not writing a novel?
You told me you were.

387
00:30:32,246 --> 00:30:33,712
No. Short stories.

388
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:36,347
I said that if eventually
I have enough good ones

389
00:30:36,349 --> 00:30:38,223
that maybe I'll try and...

390
00:30:39,552 --> 00:30:40,956
publish another collection.

391
00:30:40,978 --> 00:30:42,795
Those really didn't sell.

392
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:47,513
I just thought a novel
would be easier to sell.

393
00:30:47,631 --> 00:30:49,377
Yeah, well, maybe so.

394
00:30:51,362 --> 00:30:54,840
Ever want me to read anything,
I could critique it for you.

395
00:30:56,162 --> 00:30:56,998
No.

396
00:30:58,749 --> 00:31:02,188
I mean, I'm not at
that stage where I...

397
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:04,474
No.

398
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,294
Open offer.

399
00:31:07,987 --> 00:31:09,591
So what's up
with Walt lately?

400
00:31:09,592 --> 00:31:11,501
What do you mean?
He's fine.

401
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:14,480
He just seems,
I don't know...

402
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,218
quieter than usual.

403
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,191
Turning 50
is a big deal.

404
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:21,594
I mean, I'm sure as hell
not looking forward to 40.

405
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,967
You're gonna be
a complete basket case.

406
00:31:30,185 --> 00:31:31,457
So it's mid-life crisis.

407
00:31:31,468 --> 00:31:33,502
No, he's just quiet.

408
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,599
- How's the sex?
- Marie, Jesus.

409
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,199
Guess that answers that.

410
00:32:23,337 --> 00:32:25,324
You just gonna sit there?

411
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,608
This.
Look at this.

412
00:32:35,876 --> 00:32:38,143
Kjeldahl-style
recovery flask,

413
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:40,434
800 milliliters.
Very rare.

414
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,607
You got your usual
paraphernalia:

415
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,904
Griffin beakers,
your Erlenmeyer flask.

416
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,078
But the pièce de résistance:

417
00:32:47,615 --> 00:32:51,460
a round bottom boiling flask.
5,000 milliliters.

418
00:32:55,221 --> 00:32:56,982
Well, I cook in one of those.

419
00:32:57,113 --> 00:32:58,400
The big one.

420
00:32:59,462 --> 00:33:00,686
One of these?

421
00:33:01,462 --> 00:33:04,453
No, this is a volumetric flask.
You wouldn't cook in one of these.

422
00:33:04,893 --> 00:33:06,202
Yeah, I do.

423
00:33:06,532 --> 00:33:07,875
No, you don't.

424
00:33:08,146 --> 00:33:11,743
A volumetric flask is
for general mixing and titration.

425
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:15,085
You wouldn't apply heat
to a volumetric flask.

426
00:33:15,115 --> 00:33:17,396
That's what
a boiling flask is for.

427
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:19,653
Did you learn nothing
from my chemistry class?

428
00:33:20,864 --> 00:33:22,797
No. You flunked me.

429
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:24,971
- Remember?
- No wonder.

430
00:33:24,973 --> 00:33:25,883
Prick.

431
00:33:26,368 --> 00:33:29,874
Now let me tell you something else.
This ain't chemistry,

432
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,530
this is art.

433
00:33:32,286 --> 00:33:33,854
Cooking is art.

434
00:33:33,893 --> 00:33:37,095
And the shit I cook is the bomb,
so don't be telling me.

435
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,286
The shit you cook is shit.

436
00:33:39,857 --> 00:33:41,906
I saw your setup.
Ridiculous.

437
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:44,472
You and I
will not make garbage.

438
00:33:44,808 --> 00:33:46,738
We will produce
a chemically pure

439
00:33:46,746 --> 00:33:49,066
and stable product
that performs as advertised.

440
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,674
No adulterants. No baby formula.
No chili powder.

441
00:33:51,689 --> 00:33:53,802
No, no, chili P
is my signature.

442
00:33:53,808 --> 00:33:55,071
Not anymore.

443
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:58,559
Yeah, well,
we'll see about that.

444
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,071
- What the hell is this?
- Lab safety equipment.

445
00:34:02,095 --> 00:34:05,229
We're also gonna have
an emergency eye wash station.

446
00:34:05,761 --> 00:34:08,580
These chemicals
and their fumes are toxic,

447
00:34:08,862 --> 00:34:10,290
in case you didn't know that.

448
00:34:10,313 --> 00:34:13,036
Well, you can dress up
like a faggot if you want.

449
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,115
Not me.

450
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:22,746
Listen, this stuff doesn't
stay more than a day.

451
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:25,667
What? I thought
we were gonna cook here.

452
00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:27,332
No, we're not
gonna cook here.

453
00:34:27,364 --> 00:34:30,169
Okay, this is my house.
I don't shit where I eat.

454
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:32,326
Well, then, where
are we gonna work?

455
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:33,615
You tell me.

456
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:35,002
This is your deal.

457
00:34:35,005 --> 00:34:37,846
You want to smoke it up,
smoke it up at your house.

458
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:39,732
Nah, I didn't think so.

459
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:41,000
Oh, well.

460
00:34:42,826 --> 00:34:43,960
Well...

461
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:48,222
what if we rented one
of those self-storage places,

462
00:34:48,241 --> 00:34:51,042
you know, those little orange garages,
worked out of there?

463
00:34:51,074 --> 00:34:51,887
No.

464
00:34:52,352 --> 00:34:55,380
They're on to that.
They got dogs that sniff around.

465
00:34:56,807 --> 00:34:59,455
RV. That's what you want.

466
00:35:00,633 --> 00:35:02,349
What, like a Winnebago?

467
00:35:04,513 --> 00:35:05,334
Yeah.

468
00:35:07,645 --> 00:35:09,839
I know a dude
who wants to sell his.

469
00:35:10,056 --> 00:35:12,026
He just goes camping with it.

470
00:35:12,394 --> 00:35:14,107
But a mobile meth lab?

471
00:35:14,271 --> 00:35:16,047
That'd be the bomb.
I mean,

472
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,144
drive way out
in the boonies.

473
00:35:18,808 --> 00:35:20,365
Be all evasive.

474
00:35:49,697 --> 00:35:52,679
Dude, this isn't even 7 grand.
My guy wants 85.

475
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:55,318
This is all the money
I have in the world.

476
00:35:56,142 --> 00:35:58,319
You're a drug dealer.
Negotiate.

477
00:36:00,048 --> 00:36:02,683
You are not how
I remember you from class,

478
00:36:02,685 --> 00:36:04,322
I mean, like, not at all.

479
00:36:04,632 --> 00:36:07,188
- I gotta go.
- Wait, wait. Hold on.

480
00:36:08,361 --> 00:36:10,565
Tell me why
you're doing this.

481
00:36:10,806 --> 00:36:12,000
Seriously.

482
00:36:12,266 --> 00:36:13,629
Why do you do it?

483
00:36:13,689 --> 00:36:15,659
Money, mainly.

484
00:36:17,222 --> 00:36:19,998
- There you go.
- Nah, come on!

485
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:23,736
Man, some straight like you,
giant stick up his ass,

486
00:36:23,741 --> 00:36:25,486
all of a sudden
at age, what, 60,

487
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,279
he's just gonna break bad?

488
00:36:27,413 --> 00:36:30,012
- I'm 50.
- It's weird is all, okay?

489
00:36:30,205 --> 00:36:31,953
It doesn't compute.
Listen...

490
00:36:32,053 --> 00:36:34,833
if you've gone crazy
or something...

491
00:36:34,837 --> 00:36:37,556
I mean, if you've...
if you've gone crazy

492
00:36:37,848 --> 00:36:40,311
or depressed,
I'm just saying...

493
00:36:42,384 --> 00:36:44,743
that's something
I need to know about.

494
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:47,307
Okay?
I mean, that affects me.

495
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,170
I am awake.

496
00:36:59,048 --> 00:36:59,929
What?

497
00:37:03,776 --> 00:37:05,179
Buy the RV.

498
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:08,360
We start tomorrow.

499
00:37:14,342 --> 00:37:16,194
How's it coming
in there?

500
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,770
Fine.

501
00:37:25,624 --> 00:37:27,594
Do you want me
or your dad?

502
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:30,816
Dad.

503
00:37:47,246 --> 00:37:49,897
So how are those feeling in the waist?
Are they too tight?

504
00:37:49,898 --> 00:37:52,559
'Cause you don't want to get 'em
if they're too tight.

505
00:37:54,035 --> 00:37:55,766
They're pre-shrunk.

506
00:37:55,971 --> 00:37:58,613
Are you sure you don't want
to get a different kind.

507
00:37:58,614 --> 00:38:00,634
Like, you know,
the skinny jeans?

508
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:02,656
Those are really supposed
to be in style now.

509
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:03,996
The skaters wear them.

510
00:38:04,044 --> 00:38:05,723
Do I look like a skater?

511
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,170
All right.

512
00:38:07,695 --> 00:38:10,408
Mom, look at
my big-boy pants.

513
00:38:11,743 --> 00:38:14,862
Mommy, could you
zip up my big-boy pants?

514
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,987
- Don't.
- What?

515
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,432
Don't.

516
00:38:26,585 --> 00:38:27,428
Walt.

517
00:38:30,213 --> 00:38:31,837
- Where...
- I have no idea.

518
00:38:33,794 --> 00:38:35,942
You know what?
Don't even look at them.

519
00:38:35,984 --> 00:38:38,085
They're obviously
very stupid.

520
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:40,111
Yep.

521
00:38:42,326 --> 00:38:43,781
I think that, um...

522
00:38:43,865 --> 00:38:45,733
I think those jeans
look really good on you.

523
00:38:45,735 --> 00:38:48,343
You should get 'em
if you like 'em, okay?

524
00:38:48,385 --> 00:38:50,308
Why don't you just hang out
here for a second?

525
00:38:50,312 --> 00:38:51,761
I'll be right back.

526
00:38:51,825 --> 00:38:52,705
Fine.

527
00:38:53,014 --> 00:38:56,872
Mommy, I think I pinched a loaf
in my brand-new big-boy pants.

528
00:39:04,514 --> 00:39:06,593
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong, chief?

529
00:39:06,612 --> 00:39:08,540
Having a little trouble
walking?

530
00:39:08,567 --> 00:39:10,559
Get off me.
Get off me!

531
00:39:14,136 --> 00:39:15,552
I'll mess you up, man.

532
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:18,638
Well, you'll have one shot.
You better make it good.

533
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:20,874
What, are you waiting
for your girlfriends?

534
00:39:20,884 --> 00:39:22,475
You better go. Take it.

535
00:39:22,551 --> 00:39:24,207
Take your shot.
Take it!

536
00:39:25,089 --> 00:39:27,249
Come on. Come on.

537
00:39:27,442 --> 00:39:29,822
- Come on, let's get outta here.
- Let's go.

538
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:32,839
Psycho.

539
00:40:10,264 --> 00:40:11,996
Yeah,
nothing but cows!

540
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:16,243
Got some big cow house
way out that way, like 2 miles,

541
00:40:16,253 --> 00:40:18,373
but I don't see nobody.

542
00:40:19,029 --> 00:40:20,447
Cow house?

543
00:40:21,036 --> 00:40:22,901
Yeah, where they live.

544
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:25,109
The cows.

545
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,471
Whatever, man.

546
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,623
Yeah, let's cook here.

547
00:40:32,022 --> 00:40:33,485
Cow house.

548
00:40:34,621 --> 00:40:35,741
God help me.

549
00:40:47,747 --> 00:40:49,344
What are you doing?

550
00:40:49,436 --> 00:40:51,376
These are my good clothes.

551
00:40:52,496 --> 00:40:54,724
I can't go home smelling
like a meth lab.

552
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,141
Yeah, you can.
I do.

553
00:40:58,522 --> 00:40:59,612
Those?

554
00:41:01,013 --> 00:41:03,878
Those, uh...
You're keeping those on, right?

555
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:12,762
Come on.

556
00:41:12,817 --> 00:41:14,632
Daylight's burning.

557
00:41:15,017 --> 00:41:16,017
Oh, my God.

558
00:41:24,235 --> 00:41:26,700
Oh, this is, uh...
this is a good look for you.

559
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:30,525
And you're maybe only the world's
second biggest homo.

560
00:41:30,548 --> 00:41:32,748
Would you shut up
and help me?

561
00:41:33,438 --> 00:41:34,356
Oh, yeah.

562
00:41:35,042 --> 00:41:36,493
Oh, yeah, work it.

563
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,256
Baby, work it.

564
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:40,693
Turn that off!

565
00:42:47,746 --> 00:42:49,330
This is glass grade.

566
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,066
I mean, you got...

567
00:42:52,227 --> 00:42:55,857
Jesus, you got crystals in here
2 inches, 3 inches long.

568
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,052
This is pure glass.

569
00:42:59,887 --> 00:43:01,514
You're a damn artist.

570
00:43:02,326 --> 00:43:04,714
This is art,
Mr. White.

571
00:43:05,606 --> 00:43:07,945
Actually, it's just
basic chemistry,

572
00:43:08,024 --> 00:43:10,342
but thank you, Jesse.
I'm glad it's acceptable.

573
00:43:10,536 --> 00:43:13,431
Acceptable?
You're the goddamn Iron Chef.

574
00:43:13,645 --> 00:43:17,497
Every jibbhead from here to Timbuktu
is going to want a taste.

575
00:43:17,759 --> 00:43:19,744
Now I gotta...
I gotta try this.

576
00:43:20,028 --> 00:43:21,662
No. No.

577
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,731
No, we only sell it.
We don't use it.

578
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,285
Okay, since when?

579
00:43:29,262 --> 00:43:31,959
Listen, you've been watching
way too much Miami Vice.

580
00:43:31,999 --> 00:43:33,718
That ain't happening.

581
00:43:37,074 --> 00:43:39,462
So... what now?

582
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:43,100
How do we proceed?

583
00:43:47,056 --> 00:43:48,818
We cook more tomorrow.

584
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:51,542
Meantime...

585
00:43:52,527 --> 00:43:54,324
I know just the guy to talk to.

586
00:44:05,506 --> 00:44:07,554
Kraze, how you doing,
my man?

587
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:13,697
You got a new dog.
Right on, man.

588
00:44:13,813 --> 00:44:15,206
What's his name?

589
00:44:16,615 --> 00:44:18,870
Yeah, I had
a dog like that once,

590
00:44:18,871 --> 00:44:20,918
except maybe,
like, twice as big.

591
00:44:22,241 --> 00:44:23,670
Super purebred.

592
00:44:23,973 --> 00:44:27,438
Now, me personally, I would train him
to go straight for the nuts...

593
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:29,796
Just shut your mouth
and show me your money.

594
00:44:29,835 --> 00:44:31,570
I ain't buying, ese.

595
00:44:32,278 --> 00:44:33,577
I'm selling.

596
00:44:42,995 --> 00:44:45,294
Tell me that ain't
the finest scante

597
00:44:45,326 --> 00:44:46,909
you ever laid eyes on.

598
00:44:47,411 --> 00:44:49,156
Go ahead, try it.

599
00:44:50,005 --> 00:44:51,234
Hey, poochie.

600
00:44:51,619 --> 00:44:52,883
How you doing?

601
00:44:52,987 --> 00:44:55,120
Jesus Christ.

602
00:44:57,971 --> 00:44:59,504
See? What'd I say?

603
00:44:59,638 --> 00:45:02,360
- It's all right.
- It's all right? It's all right?

604
00:45:02,439 --> 00:45:04,889
- Yeah, it's all right.
- So, what? You back in business?

605
00:45:04,904 --> 00:45:06,486
Hell, yeah, I'm back.

606
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,233
With a vengeance.

607
00:45:08,244 --> 00:45:10,357
Vato loco gotta make a living.

608
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:13,412
You know, with your cousin
gone away and all.

609
00:45:14,107 --> 00:45:16,645
And listen, homes,
about that.

610
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,554
It really broke me up
about Emilio.

611
00:45:21,454 --> 00:45:23,412
That dude
is like my brother.

612
00:45:23,755 --> 00:45:25,149
He okay?
You talk to him?

613
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:26,786
Yeah, yeah,
I talked to him.

614
00:45:26,815 --> 00:45:28,653
He said when the Feds came,
you were out

615
00:45:28,656 --> 00:45:30,880
sticking it
in some neighbor lady.

616
00:45:31,014 --> 00:45:33,380
Hey, you know,
I got lucky twice.

617
00:45:33,393 --> 00:45:35,007
I don't know, man.

618
00:45:35,472 --> 00:45:36,472
Emilio...

619
00:45:39,284 --> 00:45:41,354
He thinks maybe
you dimed on him.

620
00:45:43,118 --> 00:45:44,592
That is bullshit.

621
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:47,988
That is bullshit,
Krazy-8!

622
00:45:48,152 --> 00:45:51,139
I should kick his punk ass
for even thinking that.

623
00:45:51,342 --> 00:45:53,995
You know what?
Next time you talk to Emilio,

624
00:45:54,054 --> 00:45:56,159
you tell him for me,
all right?

625
00:45:59,784 --> 00:46:01,725
Why don't you
tell him yourself?

626
00:46:03,155 --> 00:46:05,552
- Made bail this morning.
- Go ahead, pendejo.

627
00:46:06,252 --> 00:46:07,326
Kick my ass.

628
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:08,817
Hey, listen...

629
00:46:12,122 --> 00:46:13,927
Where did you get this?

630
00:46:15,801 --> 00:46:18,906
Because I know your little
punk ass didn't cook it.

631
00:46:47,289 --> 00:46:48,618
Hey, man.

632
00:46:49,204 --> 00:46:50,995
You some kind of nudist?

633
00:46:53,309 --> 00:46:56,598
That's some stone-fine tick tick
you been cooking there, ese.

634
00:46:56,663 --> 00:46:58,765
How about you come
work for me?

635
00:47:00,136 --> 00:47:02,493
I'd be willing
to sell it to you if...

636
00:47:03,243 --> 00:47:04,750
the price is right.

637
00:47:15,485 --> 00:47:17,873
You out here
all by yourself, huh?

638
00:47:26,384 --> 00:47:27,936
I know you.

639
00:47:27,948 --> 00:47:30,642
He was there when I got busted.
He's with the DEA!

640
00:47:30,755 --> 00:47:31,588
No.

641
00:47:32,056 --> 00:47:33,838
You ratasnitch
motherfucker!

642
00:47:34,849 --> 00:47:36,491
Run, Mr. White! Run!

643
00:47:46,388 --> 00:47:48,134
I say we cap 'em both.

644
00:47:55,342 --> 00:47:57,671
Hey, you really
cook up that batch?

645
00:47:59,331 --> 00:48:00,107
Yeah.

646
00:48:01,782 --> 00:48:03,170
You an artist.

647
00:48:05,332 --> 00:48:06,759
It's a damn shame.

648
00:48:06,793 --> 00:48:09,085
Wait! Wait a minute.

649
00:48:10,394 --> 00:48:11,633
Listen to me.

650
00:48:12,379 --> 00:48:14,140
I'll teach you my recipe.

651
00:48:15,134 --> 00:48:17,846
What do you say?
You want to cook like me?

652
00:48:20,582 --> 00:48:22,374
You let us both live...

653
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:25,284
and I will teach you.

654
00:48:56,593 --> 00:48:58,167
Put the cigarette out.

655
00:49:01,218 --> 00:49:02,286
Please.

656
00:49:46,691 --> 00:49:48,066
Move it, homes.

657
00:49:48,332 --> 00:49:49,994
We ain't got all day.

658
00:49:52,722 --> 00:49:53,647
Okay.

659
00:54:04,807 --> 00:54:06,135
What happened?

660
00:54:10,189 --> 00:54:11,980
What'd you
do to them?

661
00:54:13,529 --> 00:54:15,806
Red phosphorus
in the presence of moisture

662
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:19,345
and accelerated by heat
yields phosphorus hydride.

663
00:54:20,989 --> 00:54:22,362
Phosphine gas.

664
00:54:23,262 --> 00:54:24,888
One good whiff and...

665
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:51,238
We gotta...

666
00:54:53,742 --> 00:54:56,220
We gotta... clean this up.

667
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:46,756
Where were you?

668
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,260
Walt.

669
00:55:59,667 --> 00:56:02,618
I don't know what's been going on
with you lately, but...

670
00:56:02,619 --> 00:56:04,966
Nothing.
I'm fine.

671
00:56:05,181 --> 00:56:06,808
Whatever it is...

672
00:56:07,581 --> 00:56:09,197
I'll tell you this.

673
00:56:10,035 --> 00:56:12,969
I do not like it
when you don't talk to me.

674
00:56:14,587 --> 00:56:17,323
The worst thing
you can do is shut me out.

675
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,484
Walter, is that you?

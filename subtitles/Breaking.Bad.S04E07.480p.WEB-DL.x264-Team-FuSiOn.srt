1
00:00:23,647 --> 00:00:26,452
<i>Came out of nowhere.</i>
<i>You gotta help us.</i>

2
00:00:29,457 --> 00:00:31,259
<i>Look at all this damn water.</i>

3
00:00:31,294 --> 00:00:32,995
<i>Don't drink that.</i>

4
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:35,464
<i>Ain't no telling</i>
<i>what's gonna be poison.</i>


6
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:09,773
How's Junior?

7
00:02:09,807 --> 00:02:12,276
Oh, exactly what I expected.

8
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,511
He hasn't said a word to me

9
00:02:13,545 --> 00:02:15,780
since we told him
it was going back.

10
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:19,384
I spoke to the dealership.
They didn't want to take it.

11
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:20,486
What?

12
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:23,488
It's in perfect condition.

13
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:26,091
It's got 17 miles
on the odometer.

14
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,393
I know. I spent
the better part of an hour

15
00:02:28,428 --> 00:02:31,196
sweet-talking the manager
down to a restocking fee--

16
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,532
$800.

17
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:36,134
$800... for two days?

18
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:39,704
Well, the law says they don't
have to take it back at all.

19
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:42,474
All right,
here's the registration,

20
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:43,943
and the window sticker,
the receipt.

21
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:46,446
Oh, and make sure you talk
to the general manager.

22
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,481
His name is Glen.

23
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:49,949
Glen.

24
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,317
Call me if there's a problem.

25
00:02:51,352 --> 00:02:54,088
And please, just don't--

26
00:02:54,122 --> 00:02:55,823
don't tangle with anyone.

27
00:03:01,296 --> 00:03:02,696
Fine.

28
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:06,600
Oh! <i>Bueno, Martine.</i>
<i>Muy bueno.</i>

29
00:03:06,635 --> 00:03:07,735
Walt.

30
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,448
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

31
00:03:55,786 --> 00:03:57,620
Hoo! Whoo!

32
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:22,881
Shit.

33
00:04:37,429 --> 00:04:38,930
God.

34
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,468
Yes. Hello.

35
00:06:22,503 --> 00:06:23,770
I need a cab.

36
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:27,408
Yes, thank you.
The name is White.

37
00:06:29,711 --> 00:06:34,115
Uh, I'm at the
Pavilion parking lot

38
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:36,384
on University.

39
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:39,020
Oh, yes, that's right.
Just south of the airport.

40
00:06:40,556 --> 00:06:41,923
Oh, that'd be great.
Thank you.

41
00:06:41,957 --> 00:06:45,060
Oh, how long do you
think that would take.

42
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:52,500
No, I'm sure he'll see me.

43
00:06:52,534 --> 00:06:53,668
Thank you.

44
00:06:57,973 --> 00:06:58,973
Contrition?

45
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:00,608
Hey, there's--

46
00:07:00,642 --> 00:07:01,676
There's total contrition here!

47
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,779
There's mountains
of contrition!

48
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:06,314
Fan-tan-tastic!

49
00:07:06,348 --> 00:07:08,417
I will messenger
'em over right away.

50
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:09,651
Oh, and--

51
00:07:09,686 --> 00:07:11,587
about that
other thing unrelated--

52
00:07:11,621 --> 00:07:13,523
Yes, I can get you in.

53
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:17,427
But I gotta warn you,
the eighth hole is murder.

54
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:20,096
Oh, yeah? You want
to make it interesting?

55
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:22,265
Great! Tee time 7 a.m. sharp.

56
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:24,233
Prepare to have
your ass handed to you.

57
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:25,668
Okay. Bye.

58
00:07:27,637 --> 00:07:29,472
He was headed for
destruction of property,

59
00:07:29,506 --> 00:07:31,407
but since it's
your own property,

60
00:07:31,441 --> 00:07:35,410
I sweated him down to
misdemeanor trash burning.

61
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:38,780
The only thing is,
it's not gonna be free.

62
00:07:38,814 --> 00:07:40,782
There's a 5 grand fine,

63
00:07:40,816 --> 00:07:42,751
600 for towing and disposal,

64
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:45,320
another 3 grand
to steam clean the blacktop.

65
00:07:45,355 --> 00:07:48,324
So bottom line, your little
joyride's gonna set you back

66
00:07:48,358 --> 00:07:51,060
about 52,000 bucks, so...

67
00:07:51,094 --> 00:07:53,363
was it worth it?

68
00:07:53,397 --> 00:07:55,198
I don't need to hear
the blow-by-blow.

69
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:57,268
Just tell me it's done.

70
00:07:57,302 --> 00:07:59,470
I'm sorry, did I wake you?

71
00:07:59,505 --> 00:08:02,674
I caught this thing
before it got into the system.

72
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,175
That means
your record stays clean.

73
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:05,376
The wife never finds out.

74
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,677
I've been working magic here.

75
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:09,279
I can at least get
an "attaboy."

76
00:08:10,882 --> 00:08:12,349
Fine. Rebel without a cause,

77
00:08:12,383 --> 00:08:13,684
give.

78
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:29,065
What is it, Fring?

79
00:08:30,734 --> 00:08:33,069
He will see me dead...

80
00:08:33,104 --> 00:08:35,606
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

81
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,510
All that's left is to wait.

82
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:44,616
And we're sure about this.

83
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,552
'Cause Pinkman ss
he needs you too much.

84
00:08:47,586 --> 00:08:48,920
"Pinkman says."

85
00:08:54,962 --> 00:08:56,463
"Pinkman says."

86
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,371
Unless...

87
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:08,073
you could help me
find a third party.

88
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:10,743
What third party?

89
00:09:10,777 --> 00:09:14,146
Someone who can
ameliorate the situation.

90
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,682
Let's ditch the thesaurus,
all right?

91
00:09:17,716 --> 00:09:19,950
You talking about a hit man?

92
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:22,386
Assuming that's still
what they're called.

93
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:24,388
Zzzzt! Wrong answer!

94
00:09:24,423 --> 00:09:27,224
That's what the kids
call "epic fail."

95
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:29,527
All I would
need is a phone number.

96
00:09:29,562 --> 00:09:31,262
I would do the rest.

97
00:09:31,297 --> 00:09:33,932
Saul, there'd be
a finder's fee.

98
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:35,234
A big one.

99
00:09:35,268 --> 00:09:37,236
Look, if you held
my feet to the fire,

100
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,338
I could come up
with a couple names--

101
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:41,107
One or two guys
west of the Rockies

102
00:09:41,141 --> 00:09:42,308
who do this kind of work--

103
00:09:42,343 --> 00:09:43,610
But guess what.

104
00:09:43,644 --> 00:09:45,445
These guys?
They know Mike.

105
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:47,581
- And Mike knows them.
- What are you telling me?

106
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:50,150
Mike knows everyone
who does this?

107
00:09:50,185 --> 00:09:51,885
Who do you think
gave me their names?

108
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,887
Okay, Plan B.

109
00:09:53,922 --> 00:09:55,723
Look, we go outside
my network--

110
00:09:55,758 --> 00:09:58,727
Craigslist, <i>Soldier of Fortune.</i>

111
00:09:58,761 --> 00:10:00,295
Let's say we get lucky,

112
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,797
I mean, incredibly lucky,

113
00:10:01,832 --> 00:10:04,067
and find a guy who's
not an undercover cop

114
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:07,069
or some kind of survivalist
nut-job wannabe.

115
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:10,573
You gotta ask yourself--
How good is good enough?

116
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:12,075
Because whatever goomba we buy

117
00:10:12,109 --> 00:10:13,710
at some point is gonna
come head-to-head

118
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:14,811
with our friend Mike.

119
00:10:14,846 --> 00:10:16,213
And Gus Fring?

120
00:10:16,247 --> 00:10:17,949
Just winging that guy

121
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,885
is not gonna ameliorate
your situation,

122
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,786
not by a damn sight.

123
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:26,290
I tried to, but I can't
get anywhere near him.

124
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:27,757
You can't get near him?

125
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:30,127
Why don't you ask your partner?

126
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:35,867
Yeah, I saw him.

127
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:40,472
And you tell Saul
before you tell me?

128
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:43,175
Look, he's my lawyer,
same as yours.

129
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,876
Every time I go over there,

130
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,645
Saul hassles me about Mike.

131
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,582
He's still scared the dude's
gonna come break his legs.

132
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:52,451
So I give him the latest.

133
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,587
But what happened exactly?

134
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:57,991
I was at a diner with Mike,

135
00:10:58,026 --> 00:11:01,995
and he just shows up.

136
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,431
They send me outside
and the two of them talk.

137
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:05,599
That's it.

138
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:10,470
So this is, like,
a regular thing?

139
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,641
How close were you to him?

140
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:16,176
Close.

141
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,179
Closer than you
and me right now.

142
00:11:21,783 --> 00:11:23,017
Did he speak to you?

143
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:30,390
It was over in 10 seconds.

144
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:32,225
Would you just answer?

145
00:11:33,828 --> 00:11:35,662
He said he sees things
in people.

146
00:11:37,398 --> 00:11:40,700
What things? What people?

147
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:42,202
Me.

148
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:44,737
He said he sees
something in me.

149
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:51,945
A month ago,

150
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:55,181
Gus was trying
to kill both of us,

151
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:57,283
and now he pulls you
out of the lab

152
00:11:57,318 --> 00:12:00,086
and employs you as...

153
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:02,388
what, an assistant gunman?

154
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:04,491
A tough guy?

155
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:06,626
Does that make
any sense to you?

156
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:11,364
He says he sees
something in you.

157
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:16,102
What kind of game
is he playing?

158
00:12:16,137 --> 00:12:18,004
Does he think
you're that naive?

159
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:24,377
He can't truly think
that you'd forget--

160
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,214
Well, let alone Gale,

161
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:29,983
let alone Victor,

162
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:33,019
and all the horror that goes
along with all of that.

163
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,822
What about this
girlfriend of yours

164
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:38,258
and her little brother?

165
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:41,327
The man looked you
straight in the eye

166
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,363
and told you
"no more children,"

167
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:46,699
but that very night,
that little boy...

168
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:50,837
he winds up...

169
00:12:53,374 --> 00:12:56,576
Gus can't possibly think
that you'd forget that.

170
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:00,246
- Okay.
- I mean, all I'm saying is that

171
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,586
is it possible he would think
that you're that weak-willed?

172
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,122
Drop the sales pitch.

173
00:13:08,156 --> 00:13:09,824
I'll do it.

174
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:12,060
You'll do what?

175
00:13:14,897 --> 00:13:17,132
I'll kill him...

176
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:19,001
first chance I get.

177
00:13:40,855 --> 00:13:44,258
Piña colada?
More like stale bubblegum.

178
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:46,060
Does anyone actually
want their car to smell like

179
00:13:46,094 --> 00:13:48,229
the bottom of
a sixth-grader's desk?

180
00:13:48,263 --> 00:13:50,298
Okay. Hemp? Really?

181
00:13:50,332 --> 00:13:52,166
Yeah, I know.
But you know what they say--

182
00:13:52,201 --> 00:13:53,667
The customer's always right.

183
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:56,003
Ooh! Speaking of customer,

184
00:13:56,037 --> 00:13:57,772
it's not too late
to have a grand opening.

185
00:13:57,806 --> 00:14:01,175
I was thinking
huge party, balloons,

186
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:02,610
bouncy house for the kids,

187
00:14:02,644 --> 00:14:04,245
you know, make a splash,
get on TV.

188
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:06,213
Let people know they're
not gonna have to face

189
00:14:06,247 --> 00:14:08,281
the eyebrows of doom
when they come in.

190
00:14:10,051 --> 00:14:12,853
Marie, how's Hank doing?

191
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:15,356
You know what?
He's doing better.

192
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,691
Really?

193
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:19,394
Yeah. Uh...

194
00:14:19,428 --> 00:14:21,863
lately his mood's improved,

195
00:14:21,898 --> 00:14:25,300
and he's like a maniac
with his P.T.

196
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:27,136
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah, don't get me wrong.

197
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,105
He's got a long way to go,
but he--

198
00:14:30,307 --> 00:14:31,407
Yeah. I mean--

199
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:33,275
- Oh, hey.
- Hey!

200
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:34,943
- Hi, Walt.
- Marie.

201
00:14:34,978 --> 00:14:36,812
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.

202
00:14:36,846 --> 00:14:40,482
Hey, your cashier here
is quite the salesperson.

203
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:42,550
She just talked me into
something called

204
00:14:42,585 --> 00:14:44,619
the Orbital Paste Wax Buff.

205
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:46,420
Oh, yeah.
No, it's very important

206
00:14:46,454 --> 00:14:47,621
to maintain your clear coat.

207
00:14:47,656 --> 00:14:49,590
Boy, once that goes--

208
00:14:49,624 --> 00:14:50,724
Oh, yeah.

209
00:14:50,758 --> 00:14:53,460
Um, hi.

210
00:14:53,495 --> 00:14:54,695
Hi.

211
00:14:59,401 --> 00:15:03,338
Bogdan was averaging
19 cars during rush hour,

212
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:05,507
and we are already up to 22--

213
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,342
22 actual cars.

214
00:15:07,377 --> 00:15:11,413
Lat night, I deposited $3,800.

215
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:17,018
Jesus. How much is that?

216
00:15:17,052 --> 00:15:20,287
$274,000.

217
00:15:20,322 --> 00:15:21,822
Give or take.

218
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:24,024
- Give or take?
- Yeah.

219
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:27,428
I haven't counted it.

220
00:15:27,462 --> 00:15:29,029
Wait...

221
00:15:29,064 --> 00:15:33,834
274,000--
And this is how often?

222
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:35,470
Every two weeks.

223
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:40,074
Thursday's good
for a drop-off?

224
00:15:40,109 --> 00:15:42,076
Wait, Walt.

225
00:15:42,111 --> 00:15:43,645
Are you telling me

226
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:49,618
you make $7,125,000 a year?

227
00:15:49,652 --> 00:15:52,221
7 1/2 even,

228
00:15:52,255 --> 00:15:53,856
before expenses.

229
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,824
But I can't--

230
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:59,060
This is too much.

231
00:15:59,094 --> 00:16:01,829
So it's more than you thought,

232
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:04,365
and this is somehow bad news?

233
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,101
No, that's not the point.

234
00:16:07,136 --> 00:16:10,605
I mean, there is
no car wash in the world

235
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,040
that could do
this kind of business.

236
00:16:13,074 --> 00:16:17,478
I mean, this is 9 month's
work here minimum.

237
00:16:17,512 --> 00:16:20,981
7 million?
That could take years.

238
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:23,450
So set some aside.
Save it for a rainy day.

239
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:25,452
Save it. What--

240
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:27,853
Save it where?
I can't go to the bank with it.

241
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:30,622
I sure can't leave it here.

242
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,392
Ohh...
Oi.

243
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:37,162
Wait a minute.
Is this all 50s?

244
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,298
Who pays for a car wash
with a 50?

245
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,967
Skyler, I didn't
ask you to do this.

246
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,202
I was under the impression

247
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:44,937
that you had this
under control.

248
00:16:44,972 --> 00:16:48,607
I just didn't expect
this amount of money.

249
00:16:48,642 --> 00:16:50,610
The 50s are gonna be a problem.

250
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:53,679
Well, that's what this is--
Problem solving.

251
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:56,215
Skyler, this is a simple
division of labor.

252
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:57,916
I bring in the money,
you launder the money.

253
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:59,284
This is what you wanted.

254
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,854
I never wanted any of this.

255
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:04,023
I've got to go.

256
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:06,759
If you want out,
just say that you want out.

257
00:17:17,972 --> 00:17:19,439
Okay, then.

258
00:18:35,018 --> 00:18:38,020
You're telling me
you made this in the lab?

259
00:18:38,054 --> 00:18:40,056
Why not?

260
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,592
Making it in his own lab...

261
00:18:42,627 --> 00:18:44,227
seemed appropriate.

262
00:18:44,262 --> 00:18:46,330
There's not much of it.

263
00:18:46,364 --> 00:18:48,199
We had more for Tuco.

264
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:50,335
It's enough.

265
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:52,470
This is still the best way.

266
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:53,905
You go after him with a gun,

267
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,574
you'll never get
out of it alive.

268
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:57,576
But with this,

269
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,611
you slip it into
his food or drink,

270
00:18:59,645 --> 00:19:02,214
there shouldn't be
any taste or smell,

271
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:06,185
36 hours later, poof.

272
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,621
A man his age,

273
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:10,824
working as hard as he does,

274
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,525
no one will be surprised.

275
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,665
What about Mike?

276
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,233
Mike can have his suspicions,

277
00:19:20,268 --> 00:19:22,469
but that's all they'll be.

278
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:23,837
Please,

279
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:26,006
one homicidal maniac at a time.

280
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:39,553
I don't know when
I'm gonna see Gus again...

281
00:19:39,587 --> 00:19:40,954
I mean, if ever.

282
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,759
Keep it with you.

283
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:48,695
When you have the opportunity,

284
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,463
be ready.

285
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:54,568
What if they search me?

286
00:19:57,538 --> 00:19:59,507
Will they do that?

287
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:53,027
It's the wrong way around.

288
00:20:55,764 --> 00:20:58,199
It's my lucky cigarette.

289
00:21:00,836 --> 00:21:04,472
Well, whatever you do,
don't smoke it.

290
00:21:06,408 --> 00:21:08,843
You know they
have a drive-thru, right?

291
00:21:08,878 --> 00:21:10,945
Nah, this is good.

292
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,247
Could use the exercise.
Get he blood pumping.

293
00:21:14,449 --> 00:21:15,616
Don't worry,

294
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,418
you're not gonna
have to pick me up.

295
00:21:17,452 --> 00:21:20,454
It might take me a while,
but I'll get there.

296
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,692
Jesus, ain't we a pair?

297
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:27,761
You must really like chicken.

298
00:21:29,398 --> 00:21:32,499
V-8, 470 horses,

299
00:21:32,533 --> 00:21:34,101
20-inch rims,

300
00:21:34,135 --> 00:21:36,203
satellite radio, Bluetooth,

301
00:21:36,237 --> 00:21:39,739
0 to 60 in 4.7 seconds.

302
00:21:39,774 --> 00:21:42,242
Whoa. What do you mean,
on a lark?

303
00:21:42,276 --> 00:21:44,744
Spur of the moment,
your dad just ups and buys you

304
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:46,879
a brand-new Challenger?

305
00:21:46,913 --> 00:21:50,215
Yeah, I barely got
around the block

306
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,452
and Mom said
we couldn't afford it,

307
00:21:53,486 --> 00:21:55,087
so they took it back.

308
00:21:55,122 --> 00:21:56,956
Do you know how long I had it?

309
00:21:56,991 --> 00:21:58,725
Fifteen hours.

310
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,562
Well, hey, buddy,
let me tell you something.

311
00:22:01,596 --> 00:22:04,498
When I was your age,

312
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:05,833
I'd have given my left nut

313
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:09,003
to drive a car like that
for 15 minutes.

314
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:11,306
But seriously,
how does that happen?

315
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,610
Well, we were looking
at used cars,

316
00:22:14,644 --> 00:22:15,644
and I kind of--
Ahh.

317
00:22:15,678 --> 00:22:16,878
You guilted him into it.

318
00:22:16,913 --> 00:22:18,280
Yeah, yeah.
I know. I hear you.

319
00:22:18,314 --> 00:22:21,215
You pulled the old "Poor little
me and my little troubles."

320
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,417
- Am I right?
- Maybe.

321
00:22:23,451 --> 00:22:25,352
Yeah, well, you flew too
close to the sun, my friend.

322
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,420
You'd have let him
buy you a clunker

323
00:22:27,455 --> 00:22:28,889
you'd be driving now,

324
00:22:28,923 --> 00:22:31,491
instead of borrowing
Mom's hooptie.

325
00:22:31,526 --> 00:22:32,892
Agent Schrader.

326
00:22:32,927 --> 00:22:34,594
- Oh, hey. How you doing?
- Well, thank you.

327
00:22:34,628 --> 00:22:35,795
Good to see you.

328
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:38,131
Walter Junior,
do you remember Mr. Fring?

329
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,333
- How are you?
- Well. Nice to see you again.

330
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:42,234
It's a pleasure
to see you here.

331
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:43,335
You're looking very well.

332
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,703
Yeah, well, you know,

333
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,639
chalk it up to clean living
and vitamin pills.

334
00:22:48,741 --> 00:22:50,508
I must apologize.

335
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:51,943
If I had seen you come in,

336
00:22:51,977 --> 00:22:53,143
there would have been
no question

337
00:22:53,178 --> 00:22:54,378
of accepting your money.

338
00:22:54,413 --> 00:22:56,614
In the future,
please feel free to ask for me.

339
00:22:56,648 --> 00:22:59,050
A DEA hero should never have

340
00:22:59,084 --> 00:23:00,518
to pay for a meal
at Pollos Hermanos.

341
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:01,619
No kidding?

342
00:23:01,653 --> 00:23:04,522
I'll take you up
on that for sure.

343
00:23:04,556 --> 00:23:06,323
And how are
your mother and father?

344
00:23:06,358 --> 00:23:08,158
They're good.

345
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:09,493
The chicken is great.

346
00:23:09,527 --> 00:23:10,961
Thank you.

347
00:23:10,996 --> 00:23:13,597
If ever you're interested
in rewarding part-time work,

348
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:15,599
perhaps something after school?

349
00:23:15,634 --> 00:23:16,634
My door is always open.

350
00:23:16,668 --> 00:23:18,336
Sounds good.

351
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,138
Uh, I don't know
about this one.

352
00:23:20,172 --> 00:23:22,808
He might eat up
all your profits.

353
00:23:22,842 --> 00:23:24,743
Well, I'll let you
finish your meal.

354
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,478
Can I get you anything else?

355
00:23:26,513 --> 00:23:28,280
A refill, perhaps?

356
00:23:28,315 --> 00:23:29,882
No, thank you.
I'm good.

357
00:23:29,917 --> 00:23:32,218
Sure. Take a Diet Coke.
Thank you very much.

358
00:23:32,252 --> 00:23:33,553
Of course.

359
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,101
So where are we going?

360
00:24:09,136 --> 00:24:13,840
Oh, big doings today.

361
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:19,614
The order of the day
is eyes open, mouth shut.

362
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:03,825
S'up?

363
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:15,237
Test, test.

364
00:25:15,271 --> 00:25:17,005
You got me?

365
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Count off.

366
00:25:29,453 --> 00:25:30,720
Let's go.

367
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,826
Right here.
Leave the wrap on, please.

368
00:25:38,897 --> 00:25:40,231
You know how to make coffee?

369
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:42,734
Sure.

370
00:25:42,768 --> 00:25:44,069
There you go.

371
00:25:46,706 --> 00:25:49,374
- You want a rundown?
- Please.

372
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:51,543
Three guys
up at the gate--

373
00:25:51,577 --> 00:25:53,044
Two visible, one in the blind.

374
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:57,114
We got five guys down here
with a backup out of sight.

375
00:25:57,148 --> 00:25:59,550
I got Tyrus
down in the treeline

376
00:25:59,584 --> 00:26:00,784
with a Barret .50.

377
00:26:00,818 --> 00:26:02,052
Planted him there last night

378
00:26:02,086 --> 00:26:03,886
in case we had
any early arrivals.

379
00:26:29,847 --> 00:26:31,948
I don't have an extra holster.

380
00:26:31,983 --> 00:26:33,683
You stick this in your pocket.

381
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:36,019
Keep it out of sight.

382
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:38,889
If you're gonna be here today,
you're gonna have a gun.

383
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:44,962
It's loaded?

384
00:26:47,298 --> 00:26:48,831
I don't want to see
that in your hand

385
00:26:48,866 --> 00:26:50,299
unless you see me with mine.

386
00:26:50,334 --> 00:26:51,701
Understood?

387
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,803
Emergency only.

388
00:26:55,372 --> 00:26:57,139
First car is coming.

389
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:04,279
All right, what's
the order of the day?

390
00:27:04,314 --> 00:27:05,948
Eyes open, mouth shut.

391
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,718
A lot of guns.

392
00:28:12,752 --> 00:28:15,820
Nobody's asking you
to give up yours.

393
00:28:18,892 --> 00:28:21,360
You want to sweep the place
before you bring in your guys?

394
00:28:22,996 --> 00:28:24,830
I am the guy.

395
00:28:28,135 --> 00:28:29,535
All right, then.

396
00:31:24,513 --> 00:31:26,280
You got something of mine?

397
00:31:33,557 --> 00:31:34,724
Glove box.

398
00:31:39,363 --> 00:31:42,132
Figure I better
teach you how to shoot.

399
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,034
Could be things
are gonna get hairy.

400
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,605
What is this?

401
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,340
You're giving me a gun?

402
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:56,010
And now I'm, like, part
of the team or whatever?

403
00:31:59,214 --> 00:32:01,215
He said he sees
something in me.

404
00:32:03,218 --> 00:32:04,251
Like what?

405
00:32:08,423 --> 00:32:12,126
If I had to put it in a word...

406
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,128
I'd guess...

407
00:32:14,162 --> 00:32:15,730
loyalty.

408
00:32:15,764 --> 00:32:17,098
Loyalty.

409
00:32:21,969 --> 00:32:24,304
Only maybe you got it
for the wrong guy.

410
00:32:43,343 --> 00:32:44,410
Jesse?

411
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,013
Hey.

412
00:32:47,047 --> 00:32:48,014
Hey.

413
00:32:48,048 --> 00:32:49,415
Long time, no see.

414
00:32:52,353 --> 00:32:53,720
How you doing?

415
00:32:53,754 --> 00:32:56,289
Yeah, you know, uh...

416
00:32:56,324 --> 00:32:57,557
good.

417
00:32:57,591 --> 00:32:59,459
Good.

418
00:32:59,493 --> 00:33:00,827
Good.

419
00:33:02,997 --> 00:33:04,899
Okay, we're going
to get started.

420
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:06,066
You coming in?

421
00:33:10,172 --> 00:33:12,573
So the truth is
we can't change the past.

422
00:33:12,608 --> 00:33:13,708
What's done is done.

423
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,476
We've got to own our actions,

424
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,611
but putting ourselves on trial,

425
00:33:17,646 --> 00:33:20,281
acting as our own judge,
jury, and executioner,

426
00:33:20,315 --> 00:33:21,448
it's not the answer

427
00:33:21,483 --> 00:33:24,051
because a lot of the time
all that judging does

428
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:28,423
is just ensure that we're
going to repeat the cycle.

429
00:33:28,457 --> 00:33:29,591
Right.

430
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:33,061
"I'm such an asshhole."

431
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:35,230
"It's totally hopeless."

432
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:36,899
"What's the point?"

433
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:38,935
"I think I'll have a hit."

434
00:33:40,237 --> 00:33:41,404
Jesse.

435
00:33:41,439 --> 00:33:44,341
What's going on
with you these days?

436
00:33:48,713 --> 00:33:51,948
I went back to the crystal.

437
00:33:51,983 --> 00:33:53,750
You sober now?

438
00:33:53,785 --> 00:33:55,152
Yeah.

439
00:33:55,186 --> 00:33:58,255
Four days.
Big whoop, right?

440
00:33:58,289 --> 00:34:00,190
Four days is four days.

441
00:34:00,225 --> 00:34:01,792
You're here.

442
00:34:01,826 --> 00:34:07,297
You still...
working at the laundry?

443
00:34:07,332 --> 00:34:08,766
How are things there.

444
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,302
Sucks ass.

445
00:34:14,106 --> 00:34:16,041
Anything
you want to talk about?

446
00:34:20,047 --> 00:34:21,314
Uh...

447
00:34:26,186 --> 00:34:27,887
a couple of weeks back...

448
00:34:29,456 --> 00:34:30,957
I, uh...

449
00:34:30,991 --> 00:34:33,326
killed a dog.

450
00:34:36,329 --> 00:34:38,563
You hit it with your car?

451
00:34:41,434 --> 00:34:43,034
No, um...

452
00:34:44,269 --> 00:34:45,870
I put him down.

453
00:34:47,273 --> 00:34:49,308
I watched him go.

454
00:34:49,342 --> 00:34:51,577
I was looking him
straight in the eye

455
00:34:51,611 --> 00:34:52,611
and...

456
00:34:54,982 --> 00:34:56,583
you know, he didn't know
what was happening.

457
00:34:56,617 --> 00:34:58,118
He didn't know why.
He--

458
00:34:59,855 --> 00:35:02,891
He was just scared, and then...

459
00:35:05,295 --> 00:35:06,996
he was gone.

460
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,665
He was suffering.

461
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,601
It was a kindness.

462
00:35:11,635 --> 00:35:14,871
No, he wasn't sick.

463
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:19,842
No, he was just, like a...

464
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:24,213
I don't know, like a...

465
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:26,682
problem dog.

466
00:35:26,717 --> 00:35:28,651
What did he do?

467
00:35:28,685 --> 00:35:29,885
Bite someone?

468
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:36,693
Uh, this dog never--
never bit anybody.

469
00:35:36,728 --> 00:35:38,228
He was, uh...

470
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:42,733
You pick up the rock,
you go right to the dark side.

471
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:44,835
Anything can happen.

472
00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:46,603
It ain't no rock
that made me do it.

473
00:35:46,637 --> 00:35:47,905
Well, what was the problem?

474
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:49,106
Why did you have to kill him?

475
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,975
Watch the cross-talk,
please.

476
00:35:53,111 --> 00:35:55,279
Maybe it's not the details
that matter.

477
00:35:55,313 --> 00:35:56,947
Right?

478
00:35:56,982 --> 00:35:59,650
How'd you feel about
what you did, Jesse?

479
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,755
I don't know.

480
00:36:06,091 --> 00:36:09,293
Who cares how you feel?

481
00:36:09,328 --> 00:36:11,997
What kind of a person
kills a dog for no reason?

482
00:36:12,031 --> 00:36:13,231
Colleen.

483
00:36:13,265 --> 00:36:14,699
You put an ad in the paper.

484
00:36:14,733 --> 00:36:15,967
You drop him off at a shelter.

485
00:36:16,001 --> 00:36:17,235
- Colleen--
- You just don't sit there

486
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:18,436
and talk about killing
a helpless--

487
00:36:18,471 --> 00:36:19,805
- Colleen.
- ...innocent animal.

488
00:36:21,274 --> 00:36:23,575
We're not here
to sit in judgment.

489
00:36:23,609 --> 00:36:25,677
Why not?

490
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,349
Why not? Maybe--
Maybe she's right.

491
00:36:30,383 --> 00:36:31,884
You know, maybe I should
have put it in the paper.

492
00:36:31,918 --> 00:36:34,353
Maybe I should have
done something different.

493
00:36:36,656 --> 00:36:38,157
The thing is,

494
00:36:38,191 --> 00:36:41,894
if you just do stuff
and nothing happens...

495
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,131
what's it all mean?

496
00:36:46,165 --> 00:36:47,966
What's the point?

497
00:36:49,936 --> 00:36:54,306
All right, this whole thing
is about self-acceptance.

498
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,041
Kicking the hell
out of yourself

499
00:36:56,075 --> 00:36:57,776
doesn't give meaning
to anything.

500
00:36:57,811 --> 00:37:01,447
So I should stop judging...

501
00:37:02,749 --> 00:37:05,484
- and accept--
- It's a start.

502
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,987
So, no matter what I do,

503
00:37:08,021 --> 00:37:10,556
hooray for me
because I'm a great guy?

504
00:37:10,591 --> 00:37:12,559
It's all good?

505
00:37:12,593 --> 00:37:14,862
No matter how many dogs I kill,

506
00:37:14,896 --> 00:37:17,799
I just what, do an inventory

507
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:19,567
and accept?

508
00:37:22,272 --> 00:37:24,707
I mean, you back your truck
over your own kid

509
00:37:24,741 --> 00:37:26,776
and you, like, accept?

510
00:37:28,278 --> 00:37:29,746
What a load of crap!

511
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,682
Hey, Jesse,
I know you're in pain.

512
00:37:32,716 --> 00:37:33,950
No, y-you know what?

513
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:38,120
Why I'm here
in the first place?

514
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,792
Is to sell you meth.

515
00:37:45,762 --> 00:37:49,098
You're nothing to me
but customers!

516
00:37:53,036 --> 00:37:55,070
I made you my bitch.

517
00:37:55,104 --> 00:37:57,472
You okay with that?

518
00:37:57,506 --> 00:37:58,906
Huh?

519
00:37:58,941 --> 00:38:00,808
You accept?

520
00:38:03,278 --> 00:38:04,445
No.

521
00:38:14,155 --> 00:38:15,989
About time.

522
00:38:46,321 --> 00:38:48,822
Jesse. Jesse.

523
00:38:48,856 --> 00:38:51,058
Bring that light
over here, will you?

524
00:39:03,905 --> 00:39:05,805
You see any residue there?

525
00:39:06,974 --> 00:39:07,940
Where?

526
00:39:07,975 --> 00:39:11,611
Here. On the bottom,
right-- right there.

527
00:39:14,481 --> 00:39:15,848
It's been a week.

528
00:39:15,882 --> 00:39:17,883
What's going on?

529
00:39:17,918 --> 00:39:19,986
I haven't seen him.

530
00:39:22,622 --> 00:39:23,856
I didn't think so,

531
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,724
but I'll just give it
another shot anyway.

532
00:39:49,814 --> 00:39:51,315
- Hey-hey-hey, buddy!
- Hey.

533
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:54,051
Look at that.
Graduated to doorman.

534
00:39:54,086 --> 00:39:55,420
Finally found your calling.

535
00:39:55,454 --> 00:39:58,289
Ha ha! Ooh!
Little whiskers, Marie.

536
00:39:58,324 --> 00:40:01,860
What did you do, show your
barber a picture of a dog's ass

537
00:40:01,894 --> 00:40:03,228
and said "I'll take that"?

538
00:40:03,262 --> 00:40:06,697
Charming as usual.
Welcome back.

539
00:40:06,731 --> 00:40:08,098
Looking good, Marie.

540
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:09,833
Oh, thanks, Steve.
Good to see you.

541
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:11,234
- How you doing?
- He's doing fine.

542
00:40:11,268 --> 00:40:12,869
We, uh, we can
take it from here.

543
00:40:12,903 --> 00:40:14,237
- Right, Gomie?
- Yeah.

544
00:40:14,271 --> 00:40:16,339
If you want to hold his elbow.

545
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:18,006
No, no, no, no.
You keep your mitts off me.

546
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,308
I'm good, I'm good.

547
00:40:23,179 --> 00:40:24,179
Hey.

548
00:40:25,815 --> 00:40:27,182
Good luck.

549
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:34,590
Let's go.
Running late. Come on.

550
00:40:39,431 --> 00:40:41,799
Hank,
seeing you walk in--

551
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:44,101
I can't tell you what that
means to all of us.

552
00:40:44,136 --> 00:40:47,404
Your progress, it's incredible.

553
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:49,273
Yeah, well, chalk it up

554
00:40:49,307 --> 00:40:50,908
to can living
and vitamin pills.

555
00:40:52,177 --> 00:40:53,544
Steve tell you his news?

556
00:40:53,578 --> 00:40:57,013
What?
Finally got your period?

557
00:40:57,048 --> 00:40:58,848
I made GS 14.

558
00:40:58,882 --> 00:41:00,883
Wow.
That's all right, man.

559
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:02,585
Next stop,
Washington, D.C.,

560
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:04,219
sitting behind a desk,

561
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:06,088
papers piled so high,
you can't see over them.

562
00:41:06,122 --> 00:41:08,457
Hey, better you than me, buddy.

563
00:41:08,491 --> 00:41:10,592
Seriously,
congratulations, buddy.

564
00:41:10,627 --> 00:41:11,760
Thanks.

565
00:41:11,795 --> 00:41:14,863
Steve said you might
have something for us.

566
00:41:14,898 --> 00:41:16,031
Yeah, maybe.

567
00:41:16,066 --> 00:41:18,567
You guys are going
to have to tell me.

568
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:21,270
Remember my pal Tim Roberts?

569
00:41:21,304 --> 00:41:22,972
APD detective?

570
00:41:23,006 --> 00:41:25,207
Yeah, well, he's working
on a murder case,

571
00:41:25,242 --> 00:41:27,743
and the victim's
a 34-year-old male Caucasian

572
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,944
by the name of Gale Boetticher.

573
00:41:29,979 --> 00:41:32,480
One night last month,
Boetticher opens the door--

574
00:41:32,515 --> 00:41:35,182
Bam, take a bullet to the face

575
00:41:35,217 --> 00:41:38,118
from a person
or persons unknown.

576
00:41:38,152 --> 00:41:42,255
Now, this Gale Boetticher is
a bona fide chemistry genius.

577
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,225
I mean, he's got degrees
up the wazoo, right?

578
00:41:45,259 --> 00:41:49,896
And, uh, as you might expect,
he's a nerd's nerd.

579
00:41:49,931 --> 00:41:52,866
Vegan, sandals and socks
kind of guy.

580
00:41:52,901 --> 00:41:58,238
As it turns out, he's also
an A-number 1 meth cook.

581
00:41:58,273 --> 00:42:00,074
And what caught my eye

582
00:42:00,108 --> 00:42:03,645
is, uh, his specialty
product's blue.

583
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:05,814
So what are you thinking?

584
00:42:05,848 --> 00:42:07,449
This is your Heisenberg?

585
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:11,353
No. What I think we got here
is, uh, ahem,

586
00:42:11,387 --> 00:42:13,355
Heisenberg's former cook

587
00:42:13,389 --> 00:42:17,126
and maybe a line
on Heisenberg himself.

588
00:42:18,729 --> 00:42:20,096
Anyway, uh, lo and behold,

589
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:24,266
amidst all the hippie-dippie
nonsense, ahem,

590
00:42:24,301 --> 00:42:25,868
I find this.

591
00:42:25,903 --> 00:42:30,306
Now, this here
I do a little Google-fu,

592
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,808
and I-- I realize
it's a parts number

593
00:42:32,843 --> 00:42:35,578
specifically for this baby.

594
00:42:35,612 --> 00:42:38,147
Now, that there
is a high-volume

595
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:42,385
HEPA industrial
air filtration system.

596
00:42:42,419 --> 00:42:44,688
That's a $300,000 gadget.

597
00:42:44,722 --> 00:42:47,224
Perfect
for a pharmaceutical plant

598
00:42:47,258 --> 00:42:48,925
or microchip factory

599
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,697
or maybe the biggest meth lab
north of the border.

600
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,801
Okay.

601
00:42:57,836 --> 00:43:00,638
So this little dingus here
is manufactured

602
00:43:00,672 --> 00:43:03,474
by a big
international concern--

603
00:43:03,508 --> 00:43:05,743
Madrigal Electromotive.

604
00:43:05,777 --> 00:43:08,212
I call their Houston office,
and eventually I get through

605
00:43:08,247 --> 00:43:10,548
to the nicest little
20-year-old temp.

606
00:43:10,582 --> 00:43:12,816
I use some of the Schrader
sweet talk on her.

607
00:43:12,851 --> 00:43:14,818
Before you know it,
she's pulling files for me.

608
00:43:14,852 --> 00:43:16,186
Turns out six months ago,

609
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,254
one of these systems
was shipped to a depot

610
00:43:18,289 --> 00:43:20,290
right here in ABQ.

611
00:43:20,324 --> 00:43:22,592
Who signed for it?

612
00:43:22,626 --> 00:43:24,160
Gale Boetticher.

613
00:43:24,194 --> 00:43:27,297
So I asked my new girlfriend
who paid for it,

614
00:43:27,332 --> 00:43:29,567
and she says "Nobody."

615
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,470
They have no record

616
00:43:32,505 --> 00:43:35,374
that anybody actually
paid for this thing.

617
00:43:35,408 --> 00:43:39,145
So I go back and push more,
and before you know it,

618
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:41,381
uh, the temp's gone,
there's no forwarding address,

619
00:43:41,415 --> 00:43:43,550
and I'm talking to some
snot-nose corporate lawyer

620
00:43:43,584 --> 00:43:45,418
who's asking me
for my badge number.

621
00:43:45,453 --> 00:43:48,055
Brick wall.

622
00:43:48,089 --> 00:43:52,292
So I take a peek
into Madrigal Electromotive.

623
00:43:52,327 --> 00:43:55,295
Now, Madrigal is based
in Hanover, Germany,

624
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:58,098
but they're what they call
highly diversified--

625
00:43:58,133 --> 00:44:00,868
Industrial equipment,
global shipping,

626
00:44:00,903 --> 00:44:02,136
major construction,

627
00:44:02,171 --> 00:44:06,575
and a tiny little foothold
in American fast food,

628
00:44:06,609 --> 00:44:09,212
specifically a local chain--

629
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,314
Pollos Hermanos.

630
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:16,286
Okay. So what, right?

631
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,554
Boetticher's dead.

632
00:44:17,589 --> 00:44:19,757
I got no line on who's
been bankrolling him

633
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:22,460
or where his lab was.

634
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:24,728
The whole thing's
a snipe hunt, right?

635
00:44:24,763 --> 00:44:29,033
But now I get this crazy idea,

636
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:31,602
and I can't shake it.

637
00:44:31,636 --> 00:44:35,438
I mean, I-- I stay up nights
staring at the ceiling

638
00:44:35,473 --> 00:44:36,639
and trying to make sense of it.

639
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,874
It's that napkin.

640
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:39,542
Remember I told you
Boetticher's vegan, right?

641
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:40,576
I mean, we're talking
this guy makes

642
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:43,045
his own fermented lentil bread

643
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:45,648
or whatever the hell that is.

644
00:44:45,682 --> 00:44:50,085
What's a vegan doing
in a fried chicken joint?

645
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:56,126
Maybe he's meeting somebody.

646
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,095
Like who?

647
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,631
Well, like maybe...

648
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:04,302
this guy.

649
00:45:08,374 --> 00:45:11,108
I mean, what do we know
about Gustavo Fring?

650
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:14,311
Huh? This whole "friend
of law enforcement" thing, eh,

651
00:45:14,345 --> 00:45:17,713
could be a case of keep your friends
close but your enemies closer.

652
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:19,949
He's got the money
to finance this operation.

653
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:21,350
Maybe he's got
the connections, too.

654
00:45:21,384 --> 00:45:23,985
Maybe, just maybe...

655
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,553
he's our guy.

656
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:31,293
Hank, no offense,

657
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:33,529
but I think
you're really reaching.

658
00:45:33,563 --> 00:45:37,300
If your guy
had his meeting at KFC,

659
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:39,136
you wouldn't immediately assume

660
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:41,205
that he's sitting down
with Colonel Sanders.

661
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,173
You know, I-- ahem--

662
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:46,277
I couldn't agree more, guys.

663
00:45:46,311 --> 00:45:51,048
Gustavo Fring, blue meth,
you know...

664
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:55,987
The whole thing
is off-the-map nuts.

665
00:45:56,021 --> 00:45:58,590
I ought to be wearing
a tinfoil hat, you know?

666
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:02,026
Except...

667
00:46:03,762 --> 00:46:07,365
I can't seem to wrap my mind
around this one little thing,

668
00:46:07,399 --> 00:46:09,234
and that is...

669
00:46:09,268 --> 00:46:12,171
what are Gustavo Fring's
fingerprints...

670
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,874
doing in Gale Boetticher's
apartment?

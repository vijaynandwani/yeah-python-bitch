Unfortunately,
only one way north.

169
00:12:18,334 --> 00:12:19,836
Come on in.

170
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:25,883
[clears throat]

171
00:12:25,918 --> 00:12:29,924
First, I want to tell you
that I get it.

172
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,930
From what you've told me,

173
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:34,134
this situation
with Walt's gambling

174
00:12:34,168 --> 00:12:38,312
sounds...intense.

175
00:12:38,346 --> 00:12:42,921
Yeah, it definitely was

176
00:12:42,955 --> 00:12:45,960
and continues to be.

177
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:50,704
So I would
greatly appreciate it

178
00:12:50,738 --> 00:12:55,048
if you would just
help me out here.

179
00:12:55,081 --> 00:12:57,585
Well, I have thought
long and hard about this,

180
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,794
and, uh...

181
00:13:00,828 --> 00:13:02,731
here's what I want to do.

182
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:04,233
[clears throat]

183
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,914
So is, uh, Walt gonna be okay?

184
00:13:10,948 --> 00:13:12,581
Are you in contact with him?

185
00:13:12,616 --> 00:13:14,586
Um, he's fine.

186
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:17,093
Good. That's good.

187
00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:21,701
He doesn't know
about you offering, uh--

188
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:23,205
No, absolutely not,

189
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:26,777
and I mean
to keep it that way, so...

190
00:13:26,813 --> 00:13:31,557
$617,000

191
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:33,894
written out to me.

192
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:38,571
Uh, what is this?

193
00:13:38,604 --> 00:13:40,907
- I can't take your money.
- Oh?

194
00:13:40,943 --> 00:13:42,411
And why is that?

195
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,415
Because at the end of the day,

196
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:48,858
paying my debt with
illicit gambling winnings...

197
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,166
I don't know.
It feels wrong.

198
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,170
It feels wrong?

199
00:13:54,205 --> 00:13:56,105
- To me, it does.
- Uh-huh.

200
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,609
I'm not judging you or Walt.

201
00:13:57,643 --> 00:14:01,117
I'm just saying I feel
uncomfortable with it.

202
00:14:01,152 --> 00:14:02,921
Well, um, Ted,

203
00:14:02,956 --> 00:14:04,925
the whole reason
we're in this mess

204
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,933
is because you had me
cooking your books.

205
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:10,706
So when did wrong

206
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,708
suddenly become
a problem for you?

207
00:14:12,743 --> 00:14:15,383
Now, hold on.
That was a one-time measure.

208
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:18,388
I took an honest attempt
to protect my employees

209
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:20,393
and save my dad's company.

210
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,399
And it might've been a mistake,

211
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:24,667
but that's no reason
to go out and make another.

212
00:14:24,702 --> 00:14:28,009
No, Ted. This is
the big mistake right here.

213
00:14:28,043 --> 00:14:33,053
You owe the federal government
$617,000.

214
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,391
If you do not pay them,
they will come after you,

215
00:14:35,423 --> 00:14:37,831
and then they will
come after me.

216
00:14:37,864 --> 00:14:39,866
And if they audit my business,

217
00:14:39,902 --> 00:14:43,106
find out that Walt and I
paid for it

218
00:14:43,141 --> 00:14:45,211
with close to a million dollars

219
00:14:45,246 --> 00:14:47,149
in untaxed gambling winnings,

220
00:14:47,183 --> 00:14:48,787
we will go to prison,

221
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,656
where you will already be.

222
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:52,160
Do you understand?

223
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:53,896
I understand you're upset,

224
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:56,236
but I think you're
overstating things, too.

225
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,571
No one's going to prison.

226
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:00,844
Oh, my God. How are you
not following me here?

227
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,848
Okay. Fine.

228
00:15:02,884 --> 00:15:05,822
Let's say I take your advice.

229
00:15:05,856 --> 00:15:08,661
I pay the IRS.
Then what?

230
00:15:08,695 --> 00:15:11,201
Then you don't owe them.

231
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:14,405
Okay. But I still
owe the bank, Skyler.

232
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,410
I'm still gonna go bankrupt.

233
00:15:16,444 --> 00:15:18,414
I'll lose my business
and my home.

234
00:15:18,448 --> 00:15:20,986
I still have to pull
my girls out of school.

235
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,989
Just because I pay
some stupid fine

236
00:15:23,024 --> 00:15:25,962
doesn't make my life
any less ruined.

237
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:33,078
So, if I'm understanding
you correctly,

238
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:37,688
you're saying you can't
take the money I gave you,

239
00:15:37,722 --> 00:15:40,493
but you can take
a larger amount.

240
00:15:40,528 --> 00:15:42,162
No.

241
00:15:42,196 --> 00:15:43,934
I'm just saying,

242
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:46,672
as much as I appreciate
the gesture,

243
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:49,945
the money you gave me
doesn't really change anything.

244
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:53,620
- Because it's not enough?
- No. No.

245
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,456
Don't twist my words.

246
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,462
This isn't about amounts.

247
00:15:57,496 --> 00:15:59,866
This is about me
doing the right thing.

248
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,975
- Ted, are you blackmailing me?
- What?

249
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:06,445
No. Blackmailing?

250
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,083
God.

251
00:16:09,454 --> 00:16:11,891
I feel like I'm not
explaining things right.

252
00:16:11,926 --> 00:16:14,565
I think you're
explaining it fine.

253
00:16:19,408 --> 00:16:21,379
I notice that, uh,

254
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,183
this is for...

255
00:16:23,218 --> 00:16:26,224
less than what I gave you,
by the way.

256
00:16:26,257 --> 00:16:29,229
That's the Mercedes. I leased it before
I knew where the money came from.

257
00:16:29,263 --> 00:16:32,637
Mmm. And now that you know, you
will, of course, be returning it?

258
00:16:32,673 --> 00:16:34,640
Well, the leases
are pretty ironclad,

259
00:16:34,675 --> 00:16:36,144
so I have to see
what's possible.

260
00:16:36,178 --> 00:16:38,849
But, yeah,
I'm gonna do my best.

261
00:16:38,885 --> 00:16:41,824
And I will pay you back
as soon as I can.

262
00:16:41,857 --> 00:16:44,897
I don't want you
to pay me, Ted.

263
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:47,636
I want you to pay them.

264
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:48,906
But, Skyl--

265
00:16:52,914 --> 00:16:56,455
Try it again.
Write a new check.

266
00:16:56,489 --> 00:16:58,793
- Skyler--
- Same amount.

267
00:16:58,827 --> 00:17:00,931
Only this time,
made payable--

268
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:03,170
- What happened to us?
- Make it payable

269
00:17:03,204 --> 00:17:06,075
to the Internal
Revenue Service.

270
00:17:08,751 --> 00:17:10,220
I can't.

271
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:11,889
You have to.

272
00:17:11,923 --> 00:17:13,993
Actually, no, I don't.

273
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:16,733
Write it.

Yeah, there's this, uh,

332
00:22:29,878 --> 00:22:32,515
industrial laundry
I want to check out.

333
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,020
It's not far.

334
00:22:34,054 --> 00:22:35,557
Just turn right here.

335
00:22:39,466 --> 00:22:41,435
What, uh--
What-- What laundry?

336
00:22:41,469 --> 00:22:43,140
What about it?

337
00:22:43,173 --> 00:22:44,844
Well, it's owned
by this company--

338
00:22:44,877 --> 00:22:46,347
this Madrigal Electromotive.

339
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,985
It's this big
German conglomerate.

340
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:51,692
Into everything.
Well, it turns out

341
00:22:51,725 --> 00:22:55,933
it's the same company that owns
Fring's chicken joints.

342
00:22:57,504 --> 00:23:00,476
[exhales forcefully, mutters]

343
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:04,452
Sounds like a real
shot in the dark there.

344
00:23:04,486 --> 00:23:06,655
I mean, you said it yourself.

345
00:23:06,691 --> 00:23:08,961
If this--
Madrigal, is it?

346
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:11,232
If it's such
a big conglomerate, then--

347
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:15,641
I mean, they must own
all kinds of businesses.

348
00:23:16,644 --> 00:23:18,113
Nah, it just...

349
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:21,787
It just sounds kind of...thin.

350
00:23:21,821 --> 00:23:24,827
Well, look at you. You lose your
hair, you go on a couple stakeouts.

351
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,801
So now you're what, Kojak?
[laughs]

352
00:23:27,836 --> 00:23:29,304
I'm just saying.

353
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:31,006
[clears throat]

354
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,211
Now, the chicken farm,
however--

355
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,784
boy, that place seems ripe

356
00:23:35,818 --> 00:23:39,190
for some kind of, uh,
clandestine activity.

357
00:23:39,224 --> 00:23:41,997
I just-- I just don't want us
to miss anything, you know?

358
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:44,804
Yeah, well, you want to talk
about clandestine activity?

359
00:23:44,838 --> 00:23:47,943
Madrigal Electromotive
also owns a subsidiary

360
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:50,449
that manufactures
this state-of-the-art

361
00:23:50,484 --> 00:23:51,950
air filtration system.

362
00:23:51,986 --> 00:23:54,957
And none other
than Gale Boetticher

363
00:23:54,993 --> 00:23:56,962
took delivery
of one of these systems.

364
00:23:56,996 --> 00:23:58,965
Yeah, a chemist
who was in possession

365
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:02,003
of hand-drawn plans
for a meth super-lab,

366
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:05,445
and was visited
by none other that Gus Fring

367
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:08,651
just days before he was
capped in the face, okay?

368
00:24:08,686 --> 00:24:10,588
Shit, this is starting
to feel like a--

369
00:24:10,622 --> 00:24:13,329
<i>like Three Days on the Condor,
you know?</i>

370
00:24:13,363 --> 00:24:15,731
Anyway, an industrial laundry
would be one hell of a place

371
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:18,604
to hide a--
hide a meth lab.

372
00:24:18,638 --> 00:24:20,108
There it is right up there.

373
00:24:20,143 --> 00:24:22,347
Just turn in there.

374
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:27,891
Well, slow down.
You gotta turn there, Walt.

375
00:24:28,994 --> 00:24:31,133
Walt, what are you doing?
You just missed it.

376
00:24:31,168 --> 00:24:33,436
I'm sorry.
It looked like a dirt road.

377
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,374
I thought you meant further up.

378
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:36,709
[scoffs]

379
00:24:36,744 --> 00:24:39,148
Just bang a U-ie
over here.

380
00:24:44,195 --> 00:24:45,262
[brakes screeching]

381
00:24:53,062 --> 00:24:55,634
Mmm. Hits the spot.
Thanks, guys.

382
00:24:55,669 --> 00:24:57,204
I said to Mom, "Ice cream,"

383
00:24:57,237 --> 00:25:01,211
but she was like, "It tastes
the same, and it's healthier."

384
00:25:01,247 --> 00:25:04,153
So, sorry. I tried.

385
00:25:04,186 --> 00:25:06,157
Frozen yogurt
does taste the same.

386
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,560
Tastes exactly the same.

387
00:25:07,595 --> 00:25:10,566
Wow. I feel, like, sorry
for your taste buds.

388
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:13,241
Weigh in here, Uncle Hank.

389
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:16,079
Hey, it's free food.
Free food always tastes good.

390
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:17,917
Free drinks even better.

391
00:25:17,952 --> 00:25:19,356
[Marie] Hey, hon.

392
00:25:19,389 --> 00:25:22,493
Can you handle another visitor?

393
00:25:22,528 --> 00:25:24,330
[Hank]
Ho-ho! Mister Magoo.

394
00:25:24,364 --> 00:25:26,000
Yeah, sure.
Hey, watch out.

395
00:25:26,035 --> 00:25:28,005
Don't run into any walls
or anything, all right?

396
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:30,711
[chuckling] Okay.

397
00:25:30,745 --> 00:25:32,114
Hey, Dad.

398
00:25:32,148 --> 00:25:34,217
Hey, son.

399
00:25:34,253 --> 00:25:36,223
So how you feeling, Hank?

400
00:25:36,258 --> 00:25:38,225
Oh, well, you know.
Kind of feels like

401
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:39,728
one of those cones
they put on dogs

402
00:25:39,763 --> 00:25:41,232
so they don't lick
their own balls.

403
00:25:41,265 --> 00:25:44,137
Nice. Thank you.
Stay classy.

404
00:25:44,172 --> 00:25:46,309
Anyway, hanging in there.

405
00:25:46,343 --> 00:25:48,313
Glad you stopped by.

406
00:25:48,348 --> 00:25:51,287
Listen, I'm-- I'm sorry
about all this.

407
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,024
That guy--
he just came out of nowhere.

408
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,028
Yeah, actually, he didn't.

409
00:25:56,063 --> 00:25:58,133
I saw him coming a mile away.

410
00:25:58,167 --> 00:26:01,941
Hey, just mark it down
as a brain fart,

411
00:26:01,976 --> 00:26:04,881
and be thankful
no one got killed.

412
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:06,886
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

413
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,791
Your Hardy Boys routine
is over.

414
00:26:08,824 --> 00:26:11,563
No more asking him
to drive you on stakeouts.

415
00:26:11,598 --> 00:26:14,002
It's too dangerous.
You hear me?

416
00:26:14,037 --> 00:26:16,206
- I'll do it.
- Oh, no, you won't.

417
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,715
Marie's right. It was
a bit shortsighted of me.

418
00:26:19,749 --> 00:26:21,718
That's why I caved.

419
00:26:21,752 --> 00:26:22,919
Caved?

420
00:26:22,953 --> 00:26:24,424
I broke down.

421
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:26,662
I ordered me
a gimp-mobile.

422
00:26:26,697 --> 00:26:28,199
[chuckles]

423
00:26:28,232 --> 00:26:30,940
I wish you would
stop calling it that.

424
00:26:30,973 --> 00:26:34,512
What do you mean,
like a handi-van with a lift?

425
00:26:34,548 --> 00:26:36,185
Nah, nah.
It's a regular Tahoe.

426
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,686
It's got hand controls.

427
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,692
I ordered it.
It should be here in about a week.

428
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:41,697
I don't expect
to be in it long,

429
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,236
but I gotta
get around on my own

430
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,209
and stop being such
a damn burden to everyone.

431
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,381
[phone ringing]

432
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:52,753
Oh.

433
00:26:54,423 --> 00:26:56,294
Oh. Sorry.

434
00:26:56,329 --> 00:26:58,265
Car wash business.

435
00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:00,903
<i>[Saul] Hey, it's me.
 Can you talk?</i>

436
00:27:00,938 --> 00:27:02,407
I can listen.

437
00:27:02,441 --> 00:27:04,644
<i>Fair enough.
He doesn't own a gun.</i>

438
00:27:04,677 --> 00:27:06,915
At least not one
that he bought legally.

439
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,587
Nor does
his home security system

440
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,591
have any kind of panic button
arrangement.

441
00:27:10,624 --> 00:27:13,029
So, way I see it,
we're good to go.

442
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,869
That is, if this is still
how you want to handle it.

443
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:20,546
Like I said,
I don't want anyone hurt.

444
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,555
All I want is for him
to write a check.

445
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:25,158
Yeah. It's gonna be fine.

446
00:27:25,193 --> 00:27:26,993
I've got my A-team on it.

447
00:27:27,027 --> 00:27:30,267
[beeps] [sighs]

448
00:27:30,302 --> 00:27:32,071
[beeps]

449
00:27:35,346 --> 00:27:37,114
[knocking on door]

450
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:45,801
Can I help you?

451
00:27:45,836 --> 00:27:48,171
Yeah. Thanks.

452
00:27:48,206 --> 00:27:50,311
Whoa, whoa.
You just can't...

453
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,587
What's this about?

454
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,522
I'll tell you what
this is about, Mr. Beneke.

455
00:27:56,557 --> 00:27:59,730
This is about you and me doing
our best to keep Huell happy.

456
00:27:59,764 --> 00:28:01,736
Huell? Who's Huell?

457
00:28:01,768 --> 00:28:03,105
This is Huell.

458
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,806
Huell, you happy?

459
00:28:04,842 --> 00:28:06,645
Reasonably.

460
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:08,384
What would make you unhappy?

461
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:11,255
This little mofo
not doing what he's told.

462
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:13,394
And if you were
to become unhappy,

463
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:14,763
Mr. Beneke wouldn't care
for that?

464
00:28:14,797 --> 00:28:17,267
I'm gonna say no.

465
00:28:17,301 --> 00:28:18,837
Well, there you have it.

466
00:28:18,873 --> 00:28:20,341
Let's go find your checkbook.

467
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:22,748
Ready? Here we go.
All right.

468
00:28:22,782 --> 00:28:25,118
We're walking,
we're swinging our feet.

469
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:26,488
There you go.
Very nice.

470
00:28:26,522 --> 00:28:29,158
Beautiful place you have here.
This way.

471
00:28:29,193 --> 00:28:34,338
So, the amount's gonna be
for $617,226--

472
00:28:34,372 --> 00:28:37,009
Whoa, whoa. I don't have anywhere
near that kind of money.

473
00:28:37,044 --> 00:28:38,846
Hold that thought.
Forgot to mention

474
00:28:38,881 --> 00:28:40,350
we know exactly,
down to the penny,

475
00:28:40,384 --> 00:28:41,751
how much money's
in your checking account.

476
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:43,089
Okay? Understand?

477
00:28:43,123 --> 00:28:45,627
You still want to say
that stuff from before?

478
00:28:45,662 --> 00:28:47,231
Maybe not. So,

479
00:28:47,264 --> 00:28:50,905
$617,226

480
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,379
and 31 cents,

481
00:28:53,413 --> 00:28:57,287
made payable to
the Internal Revenue Service.

482
00:28:57,322 --> 00:29:00,061
W-What?

483
00:29:00,096 --> 00:29:03,268
Wait.
This is, uh, Skyler's--

484
00:29:03,302 --> 00:29:04,603
Skyler White sent you?

485
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:06,607
Doesn't matter who sent us.
For right now,

486
00:29:06,641 --> 00:29:08,445
all you have to do
is worry about that.

487
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,383
Oh, my God. This is a giant
misunderstanding.

488
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:12,787
Skyler is a dear friend
of mine, all right?

489
00:29:12,821 --> 00:29:15,859
Let me call her.
We'll, uh...

490
00:29:15,895 --> 00:29:19,401
No, you're misunderstanding,
Mr. Beneke.

491
00:29:19,437 --> 00:29:21,607
Phone-call time is over.
This is check-writing time.

492
00:29:21,641 --> 00:29:23,611
This is crazy.
Skyler would never do this to me.

493
00:29:23,646 --> 00:29:25,315
Sit down and write!

494
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:30,860
There you go.

00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:36,674

00:29:38,546 --> 00:29:40,716
Yeah. Right.

498
00:29:43,356 --> 00:29:45,360
You got it.

499
00:29:51,175 --> 00:29:52,675
Huell, you happy?

500
00:29:53,811 --> 00:29:55,314
[laughs] Huell's happy.

501
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,817
All right.

502
00:29:57,852 --> 00:30:00,690
Everything else
has been filled out for you.

503
00:30:00,726 --> 00:30:03,663
All's we need

504
00:30:04,733 --> 00:30:07,205
is a signature

505
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:09,075
right there.

506
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:15,857
Great.

507
00:30:15,892 --> 00:30:17,562
Hard part's over.

508
00:30:17,598 --> 00:30:19,400
Here's what happens next.

509
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:21,503
Huell's gonna
hang here with you.

510
00:30:21,537 --> 00:30:23,507
I'm gonna make sure
I get this down to UPS

511
00:30:23,543 --> 00:30:25,178
before 5:00.

512
00:30:25,212 --> 00:30:27,549
On the way back, I'm gonna
grab some sandwiches.

513
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,321
The three of us can hang out,

514
00:30:29,355 --> 00:30:31,191
play cards or watch TV
or whatever

515
00:30:31,226 --> 00:30:33,396
for the next couple of days
until the check clears.

516
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,403
Painless, right?

517
00:30:36,437 --> 00:30:38,742
Unless you don't have cable,

518
00:30:38,776 --> 00:30:40,680
in which case is gonna suck.

519
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:41,813
So...

520
00:31:20,298 --> 00:31:21,567

Does the laundry
have to be dirty?

524
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:34,562
Nope.

525
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:48,760
Hmm.

526
00:32:17,888 --> 00:32:19,890
Someone cooked here.

527
00:32:21,293 --> 00:32:24,434
You've been out of commission
four days.

528
00:32:24,469 --> 00:32:27,006
Think we're gonna shut down
the whole operation

529
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,544
just for you?

530
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:31,483
Who cooked?
Who was here?

531
00:32:40,203 --> 00:32:42,741
[Jesse] Now, how are you
doing all those backflips?

do magical stuff.

What do you want?
I'm busy.

553
00:33:29,005 --> 00:33:31,408
We need to talk.

554
00:33:31,444 --> 00:33:33,614

to say to you, man.

Jesse, please.
I'm sorry.

557
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,734
Just one minute.
That's all I ask.

558
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:44,906
Get the hell outta my house.

Come on.
Hey.

560
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:48,982
Just give me one minute!

Let me just
explain myself here.

Okay. Let me--

00:33:52,623 --> 00:33:53,824
Shh! Shut up.

00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,063
All right. All right.
Okay. Okay.

565
00:33:56,097 --> 00:33:57,867
All right. I'm sorry.

566
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,873
I know

567
00:33:59,907 --> 00:34:02,212
that you have been cooking
without me.

568
00:34:02,245 --> 00:34:04,751
That's right.
So what?

569
00:34:06,655 --> 00:34:08,690
"So what"?

570
00:34:08,725 --> 00:34:11,029
Isn't it obvious to you

571
00:34:11,063 --> 00:34:13,033
what Gus is planning?

572
00:34:13,069 --> 00:34:15,873
He's going to use you
to replace me.

573
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:18,913
He doesn't think
you need me anymore.

Jesse--

Jesse, if you agree
to replace me,

he will kill me.

577

- That's not my fault. Jesse, please--
- We're through talking.

You gotta help me.
Please.

The last time
I asked for your help,

584
00:34:43,465 --> 00:34:45,067
you said

585
00:34:45,102 --> 00:34:47,672
"I hope you end up buried

Stay away from Pinkman...

what?

605
00:37:09,955 --> 00:37:11,958
Kill me?

606

If you could kill me,

I'd already be dead.

But you can't.

You can't kill me

610
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,739
because Jesse
wouldn't cook for you

No matter how hard you tried
to turn him against me,

616
00:37:51,108 --> 00:37:54,147
to screw with his head

617
00:37:54,181 --> 00:37:57,255
so that he would hate my guts,

618
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:01,163
and he still...

619
00:38:02,232 --> 00:38:04,368
won't let you do it.

620
00:38:05,942 --> 00:38:07,809
For now.

621
00:38:07,845 --> 00:38:09,848
But he'll come around.

In the meantime, there's the
matter of your brother-in-law.

He is a problem
you promised to resolve.

You have failed.

Now it's left to me
to deal with him.

If you try to interfere,

this becomes
a much simpler matter.

I will kill your wife.

you were my A-team.

Scram. Wh--

656
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,983
- What the hell happened to you?
- Saul-- Saul,

657
00:40:17,016 --> 00:40:19,052
this man that we
spoke of before--

658
00:40:19,087 --> 00:40:21,124
this-- this person
that you said

659
00:40:21,158 --> 00:40:23,695
could-- could disappear me,
give me a whole new life--

660
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,666
- Yeah.
- And make sure that I'm never found.

661
00:40:25,701 --> 00:40:27,304
- Yeah.
- I need him.

662
00:40:27,338 --> 00:40:31,381
Saul, Gus is gonna
murder my whole family.

663
00:40:31,413 --> 00:40:33,551
Oh, Christ.

664
00:40:33,585 --> 00:40:36,190
I need this man now.
[stammers]

665
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,261
Saul! Now, Saul!

666
00:40:38,296 --> 00:40:41,001
Yeah, yeah. You understand there's
no coming back from this?

667
00:40:41,036 --> 00:40:43,239
You're gonna get new Socials
and new identities.

668
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:46,178
You can't contact your friends
or relatives ever again.

669
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:48,350
All right.
Yes, yes, I understand.

670
00:40:48,383 --> 00:40:51,423
How are you gonna sell this to that
wife of yours and your teenage son?

671
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:52,891
I have got no choice.

672
00:40:52,927 --> 00:40:55,030
You're wanted by some
pretty scary individuals,

673
00:40:55,065 --> 00:40:56,367
not to mention the law.

674
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,702
You're a high-risk client.

675
00:40:57,737 --> 00:40:59,205
You're gonna need
the deluxe service.

676
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,208
- It's gonna cost you.
- How much?

677
00:41:01,243 --> 00:41:04,549
The last quote I got
on the deluxe was 125 grand.

678
00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:06,386
But you got four people
to vanish.

679
00:41:06,421 --> 00:41:07,956
It's gonna be
at least half a million.

680
00:41:07,991 --> 00:41:10,362
- And he accepts cash only.
- I've got the money. Now come on.

681
00:41:10,396 --> 00:41:11,865
- Please!
- Here.

682
00:41:11,898 --> 00:41:13,067
Okay.

683
00:41:14,404 --> 00:41:17,410
This-- This is a vacuum
cleaner repair company.

684
00:41:17,444 --> 00:41:19,448
What'd you expect,
Haji's Quick-Vanish?

685
00:41:19,482 --> 00:41:21,119
I don't even know
the guy's name.

686
00:41:21,153 --> 00:41:23,155
You just call that number
and you leave a message.

687
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,496
You tell them that you
need a new dust filter

688
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:29,835
for a Hoover MaxExtract
Pressure-Pro, Model 60.

689
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:32,341
I wrote it right on there.
He'll cal you back in five minutes.

690
00:41:32,376 --> 00:41:33,511
Okay. Okay, fine.

691
00:41:33,544 --> 00:41:35,446
How long does it take
for him to arrange?

692
00:41:35,481 --> 00:41:37,517
The guy works fast.
I mean, that's the game here.

693
00:41:37,552 --> 00:41:39,087
You gotta have
your family packed

694
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:41,292
and ready to go
before you make the call.

695
00:41:41,327 --> 00:41:42,795
He'll tell you
where to meet him.

696
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:45,132
He'll put you up in a safe
house until everything is set.

697
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:46,635
But you gotta bring the money.

698
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,843
He doesn't lift a finger
unless he's paid in full.

699
00:41:48,877 --> 00:41:50,545
Okay.

700
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:53,120
- Saul-- - Can't say it's
been a pleasure, but--

701
00:41:53,153 --> 00:41:55,557
I need you to do
one more thing for me.

702
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:57,295
You need to call the DEA,

703
00:41:57,329 --> 00:42:00,268
and you need to tell them
that Gus has a hit out on Hank.

704
00:42:00,303 --> 00:42:03,342
- No, you have to do it for me.
- Buddy, I gotta go on living here.

705
00:42:03,377 --> 00:42:06,948
- I'm way too comfortable in my wingtips--
- Just call anonymous then.

706
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:08,652
- You call anonymously!
- I can't! I can't!

707
00:42:08,686 --> 00:42:10,992
I'm practically
in the DEA family.

708
00:42:11,026 --> 00:42:13,062
I go to their Christmas parties,
for Christ's sake.

709
00:42:13,095 --> 00:42:15,267
They know me. They know my voice.
They'll know me.

710
00:42:15,301 --> 00:42:17,203
Please, you gotta do it for me.
I'm begging you.

711
00:42:17,237 --> 00:42:19,742
- Please. Please.
- No.

712
00:42:19,777 --> 00:42:23,349
My brother-in-law doesn't
deserve to die because of this.

713
00:42:23,384 --> 00:42:26,791
- There's no way I'm mentioning Gus.
- Okay.

714
00:42:26,826 --> 00:42:30,063
The best I'll go--
I'll say it's the cartel.

715
00:42:30,097 --> 00:42:32,235
They're coming back to finish
the job that they botched.

716
00:42:32,271 --> 00:42:33,937
You say whatever
you have to say.

717
00:42:33,972 --> 00:42:36,644
You just give me an hour
to c--

718
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,116
I-- I need to collect
my wife and kids.

719
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,819
Okay?
Just give me an hour,

720
00:42:40,855 --> 00:42:42,323
and then you make
the phone call.

721
00:42:42,357 --> 00:42:44,227
Don't forget. Please.

722
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,130
Yeah.

723
00:42:47,469 --> 00:42:49,406
Thank you, Saul.

724
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,650
[coughing]

725
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,063
[grunting]

726
00:43:17,231 --> 00:43:18,733
[grunts]

727
00:43:23,545 --> 00:43:25,882
No, no, no, no.

728
00:43:25,918 --> 00:43:27,921
Where's the rest?

729
00:43:29,124 --> 00:43:32,330
That's not enough.
That's not enough.

730
00:43:34,871 --> 00:43:37,477
[Skyler] - Walt?
- Down here!

731
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:44,090
Walt, what did
that phone call mean?

732
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:46,129
Where is it?

733
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:50,102
Where's the rest?

734
00:43:50,137 --> 00:43:52,742
The money, Skyler.
Where is the rest?

735
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,616
Skyler, where is the money?

736
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:59,625
[panting]

737
00:44:03,631 --> 00:44:05,903
I gave it to Ted.

738
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:09,612
What? You-- You did what?

739
00:44:09,646 --> 00:44:11,048
Walt, I'm--

740
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:12,416
I had to.

741
00:44:12,452 --> 00:44:14,356
For us, for the family.

742
00:44:14,389 --> 00:44:16,661
I swear, Walt.

743
00:44:16,694 --> 00:44:18,699
You gave our money to Beneke?

744
00:44:18,733 --> 00:44:22,675
Walt, please, please,
just hear me out.

745
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:23,777
Please!

746
00:44:23,812 --> 00:44:26,953
[screams]

747
00:44:26,987 --> 00:44:29,589
[sobbing]

748
00:44:31,528 --> 00:44:33,765
Walt?

749
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,506
[sobbing]

750
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,311
[phone ringing]

751
00:44:41,883 --> 00:44:43,821
[laughing hysterically]

752
00:44:44,857 --> 00:44:46,323
Walt?

753
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:48,798
[ringing continues]

754
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:54,510
<i>Hi. You've reached
the White family.</i>

755
00:44:54,545 --> 00:44:56,115
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

00:45:00,223 --> 00:45:01,793
[laughing resumes]

758
00:45:01,828 --> 00:45:03,263
<i>[Marie] Skyler?</i>

759
00:45:03,297 --> 00:45:04,432
<i>[crying]</i>

760
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:06,370
It's happening again.

761
00:45:06,404 --> 00:45:08,840
The DEA called.
They got some tip

762
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:11,213
from an informant that

763
00:45:11,247 --> 00:45:13,416
the cartel--
they want to kill Hank!

764
00:45:13,451 --> 00:45:14,754
[laughing continues]

765
00:45:14,788 --> 00:45:17,360
<i>Oh, God.</i>

766
00:45:17,395 --> 00:45:20,100
<i>They're sending agents to--</i>

767
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:23,639
<i>to our house right now
to guard us.</i>

00:45:23,673 --> 00:45:25,644
<i>God!</i>

00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:28,016
<i>When is this going to end?</i>

770
00:45:31,257 --> 00:45:33,494
Marie, I'm here.

771
00:45:33,528 --> 00:45:35,431
I'm here.

772
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:38,037
Tell me exactly what happened.

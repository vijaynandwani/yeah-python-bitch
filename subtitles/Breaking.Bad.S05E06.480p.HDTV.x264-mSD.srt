Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:03,164 --> 00:00:04,206
That's where you do it.

3
00:00:04,326 --> 00:00:06,291
- What, exactly?
- Get your methylamine.

4
00:00:06,396 --> 00:00:08,295
Rob it?
Like Jesse James?

5
00:00:08,453 --> 00:00:10,043
The children cannot be here.

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,539
You agree to that and I will be whatever
kind of partner you want me to be.

7
00:00:14,652 --> 00:00:15,788
Legacy cost.

8
00:00:16,403 --> 00:00:18,259
It should come out of your end.

9
00:00:18,398 --> 00:00:21,163
No one can ever know
that this robbery went down.

10
00:00:21,267 --> 00:00:22,377
Absolutely.

11
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:26,873
No!

12
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,478
No.

You guys didn't tell me this
stuff smells like cat piss.

15
00:04:12,278 --> 00:04:14,913
Man.
Shit happens, huh?

17
00:04:38,953 --> 00:04:40,154
I mean, I'm sorry,
but I had to do it.

18
00:04:40,188 --> 00:04:44,725
Obviously, I guess
you see it different.

19
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,760
Some of you. But I didn't see
any other choice.

20
00:04:46,794 --> 00:04:48,262
I've been thinking
about this all day,

21
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:50,130
going over and over
it in my head,

22
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:51,815
and it was the only way.

23
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:56,236
Well, it's not like
I wanted to.

24
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:58,638
The kid was on a dirt bike.
I mean, he could've just--

25
00:04:58,656 --> 00:05:00,107
He could've just gunned it
and been gone

26
00:05:00,141 --> 00:05:01,975
before we even
had a chance to blink.

27
00:05:01,993 --> 00:05:03,193
We never would've been able
to catch him.

28
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:05,329
I was thinking on my feet.
I saw a threat,

29
00:05:05,363 --> 00:05:07,414
and I took care of it
the only way that I could.

30
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:08,999
A threat?

31
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:11,502
The kid was waving at us.

32
00:05:11,536 --> 00:05:13,837
He wasn't going anywhere.
He was saying hi.

33
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:15,205
Yeah, but you don't know that.

34
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:16,673
Yeah, I do.

35
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,008
He didn't know what he'd seen.

36
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:19,259
Well, I didn't want
to take that chance.

37
00:05:19,294 --> 00:05:21,795
I-- The whole point
of this thing was that no one

38
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:23,881
was supposed know that we
were even there, right?

39
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:26,717
People weren't ever supposed to
know that anything got robbed.

40
00:05:26,768 --> 00:05:28,886
How could we have let
the kid go?

41
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:30,637
He made us. If I hadn't
done what I did,

42
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:32,172
the whole mission
would've failed.

43
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,174
I'm-- I'm real sorry.

44
00:05:35,676 --> 00:05:39,446
I really am, but I--
But did I make a mistake?

45
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:41,648
Mr. White? 'Cause to me,

46
00:05:41,682 --> 00:05:43,233
you know, respectfully,

47
00:05:43,284 --> 00:05:44,234
I was looking out for the team.

48
00:05:44,285 --> 00:05:45,786
I didn't want to kill him.

49
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,288
You gotta believe that.

50
00:05:48,323 --> 00:05:52,326
At the end of the day, it was
him or us, and I chose us.

51
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,745
And I would do it again.

52
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,382
Okay, look. Uh...

53
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:03,053
Todd, why don't you step
outside for a few minutes

54
00:06:03,087 --> 00:06:04,805
so we can talk this through?

55
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,807
Of course.
Yeah, you guys talk.

56
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:08,258
But I just want to make sure

57
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:10,511
that you know that my priority
is this business.

58
00:06:10,545 --> 00:06:12,879
Okay. That's-- that's fine,
Todd. Thank you.

59
00:06:12,897 --> 00:06:15,232
I want to be
a real part of this.

60
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:17,317
All right? If you could
just see that. I'm motivated.

61
00:06:17,352 --> 00:06:18,902
And I've got connections.

62
00:06:18,937 --> 00:06:21,488
Yeah. My uncle's got
his hookups in prison

63
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:23,857
who I think could be
a real help to us if--

64
00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:36,736
Okay. That dude?
Whack-job.

65
00:06:36,754 --> 00:06:38,372
Let's just stick
to the facts here.

66
00:06:38,406 --> 00:06:40,374
Facts? Oh, okay. Uh...

67
00:06:40,408 --> 00:06:42,793
How about the fact
that he shot a kid?

68
00:06:42,844 --> 00:06:44,795
A kid that he
didn't need to shoot.

69
00:06:44,846 --> 00:06:46,680
The boy had seen us.

70
00:06:46,714 --> 00:06:51,351
And, no, it didn't look like
he knew what he was seeing.

71
00:06:51,386 --> 00:06:54,805
But what if he told somebody?

72
00:06:54,856 --> 00:06:57,891
What if he just mentioned it
in passing?

73
00:06:57,925 --> 00:06:59,943
We can't know what someone--

74
00:06:59,978 --> 00:07:03,763
Exactly. We can't know, because
Ricky Hitler there shot him.

75
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:07,601
We, us three, should've had
a discussion about it.

76
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:08,986
We would've figured it out.

77
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:12,456
But that dickhead just went ahead
and made the choice for us.

78
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,107
Is that how we do business now?

79
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,442
Look, I understand
you're upset.

80
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,294
And what was that crap
about his uncle

81
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:19,079
with the-- with the prison
connections?

82
00:07:19,113 --> 00:07:22,115
It's just some bullshit
intimidation move.

83
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:23,950
- Come on.
- It's true, though.

84
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:26,503
He does have some connections.

85
00:07:26,554 --> 00:07:27,588
Is this a problem?

86
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,257
No. It's nothing
to be concerned about.

87
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,792
It came up in the background
I did on him.

88
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,629
Didn't worry me then.
He's just flexing.

89
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:41,151
All right.

90
00:07:41,185 --> 00:07:43,303
It seems to me that we have
three options here,

91
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:45,522
and none of which are ideal.

92
00:07:45,573 --> 00:07:48,659
One, we fire Todd.

93
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:52,195
- Yeah.
- I'm not a fan of this option,

94
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:55,482
seeing that he knows way too much
about this business at this point.

95
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,586
And we'd most likely have
to pay him to keep quiet.

96
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:03,040
And God only knows we've got
enough of that going on.

97
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,511
Two...

98
00:08:07,545 --> 00:08:09,129
We dispose of him.

99
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,172
Which leaves us option three.

100
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,174
We keep him on payroll.

101
00:08:21,192 --> 00:08:24,895
Put him back on tenting houses,
setting up the lab and so forth.

102
00:08:24,946 --> 00:08:28,532
We keep him close.
Under our control.

103
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:33,654
Now, option three
would be my choice.

104
00:08:33,688 --> 00:08:35,656
Shall we vote?

105
00:08:37,858 --> 00:08:41,194
I vote three, kid.

106
00:08:56,094 --> 00:08:57,427
You're still in.

107
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,316
Right on.
Thank you so much.

108
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,400
You guys totally made
the right--

109
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:07,404
The next time you bring
a gun to a job

110
00:09:07,438 --> 00:09:09,889
without telling me,

111
00:09:09,907 --> 00:09:13,393
I will stick it
up your ass sideways.

112
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,197
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

113
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,971
Hey, boss. What's up?

114
00:10:15,006 --> 00:10:17,424
I was just in the neighborhood.
Anything going on?

115
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,626
No. He's just hanging out
with his granddaughter.

116
00:10:19,644 --> 00:10:22,229
Well, isn't that sweet?

117
00:10:22,263 --> 00:10:23,980
Here, let me see.

118
00:11:04,188 --> 00:11:06,022
It's a dead drop.

119
00:11:06,057 --> 00:11:07,524
- What?
- A dead drop.

120
00:11:07,558 --> 00:11:10,193
He just stashed something
underneath that trash can.

121
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:12,729
Write the time down.
Roll on it.

122
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:18,485
Looks like he's leaving now.

123
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:23,957
- Anybody coming for it?
- Nope, not that I can see.

124
00:11:23,991 --> 00:11:27,711
Nobody in sight.
Could be hours.

125
00:11:27,745 --> 00:11:30,046
Could be.

126
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:32,249
What do you want to do?

127
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:15,217
<i>It's not my fault that
Murtha's got his panties in a twist.</i>

128
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:16,718

129

139
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,580
<i>This guy is slippery as hell.</i>

140
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:47,833
<i>He's been throwing</i>

141
00:12:47,884 --> 00:12:53,138
<i>The guy's a pro.

142
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:56,808
<i>One of these days, our pal</i>

143

<i>Just gotta be there</i>
<i>when he does.</i>

144
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:08,320
Teenagers. Sometimes you
just want to strangle them.

145
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:11,473
How's it going?

146
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:14,493
Oh, you know...
This little munchkin,

147
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,112
I could just keep her forever.

148
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:21,166
She is just the sweetest
little baby ever born.

149
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,984
- Yes, she is.
- Oh.

150
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:26,788
I don't see much of Flynn.

151
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:29,124
That car of his keeps
him pretty busy.

152
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:31,710
Yeah.

153
00:13:31,761 --> 00:13:35,047
More importantly,
how are you doing?

154
00:13:35,098 --> 00:13:36,298
I'm okay.

155
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:38,333
How's the therapy?

156
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:42,104
I know Dave helped me so much

157
00:13:42,138 --> 00:13:44,839
when I was going
through my little...

158
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,775
How's your guy? Um...

159
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:47,842
- Peter.
- Peter.

160
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,228
He's, um, yeah, he's good.

161
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,732
I feel like I'm
making progress.

162
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:55,033
That's great.

163
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:59,071
You know, you just keep
working through it.

164
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,694
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, honey.

165
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,831
Babe, what is it?

166
00:14:09,865 --> 00:14:12,084
It's okay. It's all right.

167
00:14:12,135 --> 00:14:14,536
Just-- Why don't you let me take Holly,
and then we'll talk about this?

168
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:15,887
No. No, no, no.

169
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,389
Okay.
All right, that's fine.

170
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,591
Then how about you
just talk to me?

171
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:22,144
Just tell me what's going on.

172
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:24,596
I just...

173
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:27,482
I need to make
the right decision.

174
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:29,985
I need them to be safe.

175
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:31,603
The kids?

176
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:34,823
They're safe.
Of course they are.

177
00:14:34,857 --> 00:14:37,859
I just miss them so much.

178
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:39,661
I just want to be with them.

179
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:42,447
Hey, you know we can bring them
back home anytime you want.

180
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:44,249
No.

181
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,500
They need to stay.

182
00:14:45,535 --> 00:14:49,588
But I just...

183
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,623
I don't know what
to do here. I--

184
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:55,743
Like, whatever I choose
is wrong.

185
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,748
Skyler, you have to tell me
what's going on.

186
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:06,388
I-- I know sometimes you...

187
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:09,524
I know you think I have
a big mouth sometimes. I...

188
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:14,112
But if you felt like you
couldn't talk to me,

189
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,148
I don't know what I'd do.

190
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:18,533
Okay. So...

191
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:21,987
So what's this about the kids
not being safe?

192
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:26,074
Safe from what?

193
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:28,627
From us.

194
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,413
From Walt and me.

195
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:35,417
Like what?
Like you're bad parents?

196
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:39,621
Because you're not.
Not even close.

197
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,623
Marie,

198
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:45,143
there are things you
just don't know.

199
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:48,129
That if you knew,

200
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:51,132
you'd never speak to me again.

201
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,354
Try me.

202
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:06,198
Okay. If you're
not gonna say it, I will.

203
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:09,701
Skyler, you have to forgive
yourself for Ted.

204
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:10,835
What?

205
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,538
You can't keep
beating yourself up

206
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:17,842
over some stupid little affair.

207
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:19,427
Uh...

208
00:16:19,462 --> 00:16:21,463
- Walt told you.
- Please don't blame him.

209
00:16:21,497 --> 00:16:25,050
I practically forced him to, and
I wasn't gonna say anything.

210
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:28,603
But I cannot stand to watch you
torture yourself like this.

211
00:16:28,638 --> 00:16:30,838
You have to forgive
yourself, Skyler.

212
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,341
You were having
all these problems with Walt.

213
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,278
And Ted is
a really good-looking man.

214
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:41,533
You're only human.
Hell, I've even thought of, you know...

215
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:46,854
I mean, not seriously, but I
totally get your temptation.

216
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,241
Yeah.

217
00:16:52,962 --> 00:16:56,164
Doesn't it feel good
to get it off your chest?

218
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,968
Oh, yeah.

219
00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:01,753
I feel better.

220
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:04,472
Yeah.

221
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:12,514
<i>For those who love</i>
<i>the taste but not the price,</i>

222
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:14,733
<i>there's simulated caviar</i>
<i>made of kelp,</i>

223
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,351
<i>a type of seaweed.</i>

224
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:18,069
<i>A fraction of the cost,</i>

225
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:20,989
<i>it looks, smells, and tastes
similar to the real thing.</i>

226
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,693
Ready to get back at it?

227
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:28,246
<i>Unlike fish caviar--</i>

228
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:29,897
We have breaking news
into our newsroom.

229
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:33,067
We've just learned that police
are now expanding their search

230
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:36,588
for a missing Mckinley County boy
after four days with no leads.

231
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:41,242
Fourteen-year-old Drew Sharp was last
seen by his parents Thursday morning.

232
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,211
Authorities are extending
their search today

233
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:46,548
east from Crownpoint to Hospah
and White Horse.

234
00:17:46,582 --> 00:17:48,600
Sharp was last seen
riding his dirt bike

235
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,685
into the desert
behind his house.

236
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,587
Investigators are asking any--

237
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:04,115
Jesse, nothing can change this.

238
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,619
Yeah. It's just
that kid's parents--

239
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:11,289
I know. Believe me.

240
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,375
I haven't been able to sleep
the past few nights

241
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:15,460
just thinking about it.

242
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,795
But, Jesse,

243
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:20,131
now, finally, we're
self-sufficient.

244
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,467
Finally we have everything
that we need,

245
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,753
and no one to answer to
except ourselves.

246
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,957
And in a year, year and a half,

247
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,143
once we've cooked through this
methylamine and made our money,

248
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:35,630
there will be plenty of time
for soul-searching.

249
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:38,266
Until then...

250
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,101
We keep going.

251
00:18:40,135 --> 00:18:43,571
And we-- we run our business
our way

252
00:18:43,606 --> 00:18:46,608
and make sure that this
never happens again.

253
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,197
Okay?

254
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:54,582
Look.

255
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:56,651
Listen, I'll-- I'll
finish this up.

256
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,421
Why don't-- why don't you
go on home? Hmm?

257
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,290
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

258
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:05,293
Yeah.
I'll take care of this.

259
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:08,680
You go on.

260
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:54,726
Hey.

261
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,010
Yeah, I was just leaving.

262
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:01,516
All right.

263
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:26,674
Hello?

264
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:28,242
Walter?

265
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,578
What are you doing here?

266
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,714
I'm delivering the batch.
What are you doing here?

267
00:20:34,016 --> 00:20:37,936
Might as well get this
over with. Come in. Join us.

268
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:46,561
- Hey.
- Hi.

269
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:51,149
Where's your cars?

270
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,735
We parked around the block.

271
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,987
You might consider
doing that as well.

272
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,292
Okay.

273
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:12,954
So what's going on?

274
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:17,308
Just since this morning,
I threw three separate tails. All DEA.

275
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:19,293
- What?
- The feds have been all over me.

276
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:22,480
This has been going on
for a while now.

277
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,065
Did they follow you here?

278
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:25,800
No.
I said I threw them.

279
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:29,571
I would never come to the headquarters
of our illegal meth operation

280
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:31,489
dragging a bunch of cops,
Walter.

281
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:34,325
It would be unwise.
How can you be so sure?

282
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,693
Well, I've been doing this
a long time.

283
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:37,278
It's pretty basic stuff.

284
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:40,982
How long has this
been going on?

285
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,985
Since about the time we
started this little venture.

286
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:47,539
The DEA, in particular
your peach of a brother-in-law,

287
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,208
has taken a keen interest
in my activities.

288
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:52,710
And you're just
telling me this now?

289
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:55,329
What, you didn't think this
information would be of interest?

290
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:56,881
Wouldn't be germane?

291
00:21:56,932 --> 00:21:58,516
I've been handling it, Walter.

292
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,935
We're sitting
on a thousand gallons

293
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,305
of stolen methylamine. Jesus!
How can you be so irresponsible?

294
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:05,890
Calm down, would you please?

295
00:22:05,941 --> 00:22:08,476
I can't believe that you
kept this from me. From us.

296
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,510
Did you know about this?

297
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,728
Mike just told me.

298
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:13,197
And I said calm down.
I've got it under control.

299
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:15,149
Oh, well, forgive me

300
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:17,735
for not having
complete confidence.

301
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:19,737
You know this can't
go on, right?

302
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:21,188
Yeah, I know.

303
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,791
And I've already decided.

304
00:22:23,826 --> 00:22:27,194
I'm out.

305
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:39,707
Okay. Well...

306
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,876
Sorry to see you go, Mike.

307
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:44,395
But I really don't see
any other way.

308
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,047
Neither do I.

309
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:47,565
Obviously, Jesse,

310
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,319
you'll have to take over
the distribution end of things.

311
00:22:51,353 --> 00:22:54,439
Mike, I trust that you'll
bring Jesse up to speed

312
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,491
on your side of the business?

313
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:59,577
Yeah.
Um, about that.

314
00:23:00,729 --> 00:23:02,563
Actually, Mr. White, um...

315
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:07,035
I'm out too.

316
00:23:08,871 --> 00:23:11,238
You're what?

317
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:15,743
I don't think I can
do this anymore.

318
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,962
So, um...

319
00:23:18,013 --> 00:23:20,715
I'm retiring, I guess.

320
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:24,769
That methylamine that we stole, that we
nearly killed ourselves trying to steal,

321
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:30,441
that methylamine, when cooked,
is worth nearly $300 million.

322
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:33,861
And you're telling me that you're
willing to walk away from that?

323
00:23:33,896 --> 00:23:35,930
We're walking away
from the meth.

324
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,482
Not the methylamine.

325
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:40,485
Jesse and I will be taking our
two-thirds and we're selling it.

326
00:23:40,536 --> 00:23:44,372
I've got a connection, a guy I
knew from my time with Fring.

327
00:23:44,406 --> 00:23:48,159
This guy has the capital,
and he's motivated. Highly.

328
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,329
Mike's thinking we'll clear,
like, five million. Each.

329
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,832
I'll pay off my guys in lock-up
out of my share.

330
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:57,284
And those legacy costs
that you're so fond of,

331
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,303
you won't have
to worry about anymore.

332
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:02,123
And then I will be
going on my way.

333
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:03,474
Jesse too.

334
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:07,228
It's a solid plan.

335
00:24:07,262 --> 00:24:10,631
You can come in on this
with us.

336
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,300
That'd be cool.

337
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:17,271
'Course, you know, you are
free to hold onto your third

338
00:24:17,305 --> 00:24:20,908
and keep cooking.

339
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,831
You'll be selling
to my competitors.

340
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,701
This guy and his crew
are way out in Phoenix.

341
00:24:29,752 --> 00:24:32,170
It's a big country, Walter.

342
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,922
Whole lot of meth-heads.

343
00:24:34,957 --> 00:24:37,508
Pennies on the dollar, Jesse.

344
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:40,161
And that's what you're gonna
sell out for?

345
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:43,181
Pennies? Why?

346
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:46,217
Five million isn't pennies.

347
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:48,136
It's more money
than I've ever seen.

348
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:51,139
And when it comes down to it,

349
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:53,725
are we in the meth business?

350
00:24:53,776 --> 00:24:55,977
Or the money business?

351
00:25:08,225 --> 00:25:10,727
Relax, kid.
There's no one there.

352
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:12,896
You sure?

353
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,898
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

354
00:25:45,262 --> 00:25:47,230
Glad to see
you could make it out.

355
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,466
I was surprised
to get your call.

356
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,569
Good surprise, I hope.

357
00:25:52,603 --> 00:25:54,971
There's one gallon,
as discussed.

358
00:25:55,005 --> 00:25:57,607
You take that back home
to your people, test it.

359
00:25:57,641 --> 00:26:01,344
If you're satisfied,
I can get the other 665.

360
00:26:01,362 --> 00:26:02,896
All right.
That's fair enough.

361
00:26:02,947 --> 00:26:05,482
Shall we talk money?

362
00:26:05,516 --> 00:26:07,150
That one's free.

363
00:26:07,184 --> 00:26:10,153
The price for the rest
is 15,000 per...

364
00:26:10,187 --> 00:26:15,041
665 gallons, that's 9,975,000.

365
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:18,328
Although I would prefer
you round it up to ten.

366
00:26:18,362 --> 00:26:21,965
Makes it easier
for my partner and I to split.

367
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:22,999
Steep.

368
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:26,869
Mm. We good?

369
00:26:28,222 --> 00:26:29,872
Yeah. I'll talk to my guys,
but I should be able

370
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,207
to put together
that cash, yeah.

371
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:32,425
Good.

372
00:26:32,476 --> 00:26:34,144
I gotta tell you,
this is worth it

373
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:36,479
just to get that blue stuff
of yours off the market.

374
00:26:42,052 --> 00:26:44,854
The blue stuff will be
off the market, right?

375
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:53,196
Now, this whole time,
I was thinking 666,

376
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:56,232
that seems like an odd number.

377
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,034
Two-thirds
of an even thousand, though.

378
00:26:58,068 --> 00:27:02,622
When I look at it that way,
it starts to make sense to me.

379
00:27:02,673 --> 00:27:05,258
That's not all
the methylamine, is it?

380
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:10,630
You two have a partner
you haven't mentioned?

381
00:27:10,681 --> 00:27:14,801
This other party wouldn't be
a problem for you.

382
00:27:14,852 --> 00:27:16,719
His territory
won't impact yours.

383
00:27:16,753 --> 00:27:18,104
You see, that doesn't
work for me.

384
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:19,722
I'm not just buying this
for the supply.

385
00:27:19,756 --> 00:27:21,024
I'm buying this for the demand.

386
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:23,926
I'm looking to increase
my market share here, Mike.

387
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:26,112
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

388
00:27:26,114 --> 00:27:28,481
I want you to tell me
that Fring's blue

389
00:27:28,532 --> 00:27:30,266
will be off the streets.

390
00:27:34,405 --> 00:27:39,158
All right. Here's
a new deal for you then.

391
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:44,330
I'll pay you 15k a gallon
for the full thousand gallons.

392
00:27:44,381 --> 00:27:48,284
Not a drop less.

393
00:27:48,302 --> 00:27:51,087
It's not mine to sell, Declan.

394
00:27:51,121 --> 00:27:54,257
Well then, no deal, Mike.

395
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:20,316
Yes?

396
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:23,419
Yes. I guess.

397
00:28:25,456 --> 00:28:27,707
I don't know.

398
00:28:27,758 --> 00:28:30,543
Why don't you come over here?

399
00:28:30,594 --> 00:28:34,380
To my house.

400
00:28:34,431 --> 00:28:36,666
Yes, seriously.

401
00:28:44,108 --> 00:28:45,141
Hey.

402
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:53,683
Yo, you sure this is okay?

403
00:28:53,701 --> 00:28:55,401
She's not here.
Nobody's here.

404
00:28:58,072 --> 00:29:01,741
All right.
So, uh...

405
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:03,076
Something's come up.

406
00:29:03,127 --> 00:29:05,361
Mike wanted to come here
to give you the hard sell,

407
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:08,665
but I figured it'd be better
coming from me.

408
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:12,969
Mike's connection won't buy
mine and Mike's shares

409
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:15,888
of the methylamine unless he
gets your share, too.

410
00:29:15,923 --> 00:29:19,375
He wants the entire
thousand gallons.

411
00:29:19,393 --> 00:29:21,877
Absolutely not.

412
00:29:21,895 --> 00:29:24,597
Yeah, I figured you'd say that.

413
00:29:24,648 --> 00:29:26,766
But I've been thinking
about it,

414
00:29:26,817 --> 00:29:30,353
and it really makes sense.

415
00:29:30,387 --> 00:29:32,888
- Kinda.
- It does, does it?

416
00:29:32,906 --> 00:29:36,726
Look, when you, uh,
when you started this thing,

417
00:29:36,744 --> 00:29:39,228
did you ever dream
of having $5 million?

418
00:29:39,246 --> 00:29:41,397
I know for a fact
that you didn't.

419
00:29:41,415 --> 00:29:45,702
I know for a fact all you
needed was was 737,000,

420
00:29:45,736 --> 00:29:48,921
'cause you worked it all out,
like, mathematically.

421
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:53,543
Look, if selling the methylamine now
means that no one else ever gets killed,

422
00:29:53,577 --> 00:29:56,412
then I vote for that, man.
Hands down.

423
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,297
And we could have it tomorrow.

424
00:29:58,349 --> 00:29:59,966
We would be out.

425
00:30:00,017 --> 00:30:01,434
You could spend time
with your family.

426
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,052
No more worrying
about them getting hurt

427
00:30:03,086 --> 00:30:04,937
or finding out
about everything.

428
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:06,589
Isn't this what you've
been working for?

429
00:30:06,607 --> 00:30:09,142
I have not been working
this hard just to sell out.

430
00:30:09,193 --> 00:30:12,945
It's not selling out.
Yes, it is, Jesse.

431
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:17,567
I ha-- We have suffered and bled,
literally, for this business.

432
00:30:17,601 --> 00:30:21,237
And I will not
throw it away for nothing.

433
00:30:21,271 --> 00:30:25,124
I don't know how else
to say it, Mr. White.

434
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:28,745
$5 million isn't nothing.

435
00:30:31,215 --> 00:30:35,218
Jesse, have you heard of a
company called "Gray Matter"?

436
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:38,388
- No.
- Well, I co-founded it

437
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:40,840
in grad school with a couple
of friends of mine.

438
00:30:40,891 --> 00:30:43,626
Actually, I was
the one who named it.

439
00:30:43,644 --> 00:30:46,345
And back then, it was just--
Oh, it was just small-time.

440
00:30:46,397 --> 00:30:48,765
We had a couple
patents pending.

441
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,300
But nothing earth-shattering.

442
00:30:51,318 --> 00:30:55,071
'Course, we all knew
the potential.

443
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:57,857
Yeah. We were gonna take
the world by storm.

444
00:31:00,327 --> 00:31:03,029
And then...

445
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,666
This, uh-- Well, something
happened between the three of us.

446
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,786
And I'm not gonna go
into detail.

447
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,622
But for personal reasons,

448
00:31:12,656 --> 00:31:14,373
I decided to leave the company.

449
00:31:14,425 --> 00:31:17,677
And I sold my share
to my two partners.

450
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:20,713
I took a buyout for $5,000.

451
00:31:20,764 --> 00:31:25,017
Now, at the time, that was
a lot of money for me.

452
00:31:26,804 --> 00:31:29,388
Care to guess what that
company is worth now?

453
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,692
Millions?

454
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:36,362
Billions, with a "B."

455
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:39,949
2.16 billion
as of last Friday.

456
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:42,535
I look it up every week.

457
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:45,238
And I sold my share,

458
00:31:45,289 --> 00:31:47,707
my potential,

459
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:51,661
for $5,000.

460
00:31:51,695 --> 00:31:55,832
I sold my kids' birthright
for a few months' rent.

461
00:31:55,866 --> 00:31:58,501
This isn't the same thing.

462
00:32:01,054 --> 00:32:03,973
Jesse, you asked me

463
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:08,060
if I was in the meth business
or the money business.

464
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:10,813
Neither.

465
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:13,215
I'm in the empire business.

466
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:20,523
I don't know.

467
00:32:20,557 --> 00:32:25,862
Mr. White, is a meth empire really
something to be that proud of?

468
00:32:40,243 --> 00:32:42,211
Skyler, you remember Jesse.

469
00:32:42,245 --> 00:32:44,430
Jesse, this is my wife, Skyler.

470
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:46,265
Hey, Mrs. White.

471
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,934
Good to see you.

472
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:50,052
You have a lovely home.

473
00:32:50,086 --> 00:32:52,305
- I was just heading out.
- Why don't you stay for dinner?

474
00:32:52,356 --> 00:32:56,275
- No, Mr. White. I'm gonna go.
- Stay.

475
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:59,478
Come on. It'll be fun.

476
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,614
It's okay with us,
isn't it, Skyler?

477
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:03,766
We don't have anything
special planned tonight.

478
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:10,272
Yeah.

479
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,158
Sure.

480
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:17,129
Why not?

481
00:33:19,282 --> 00:33:21,751
See?

482
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:43,155
Mm.

483
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,475
These are great green beans,
Mrs. White.

484
00:33:46,493 --> 00:33:50,663
I like that you got
the slivered almonds going.

485
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:53,783
My mom always
made them like that.

486
00:33:53,817 --> 00:33:55,985
You put lemon in there, too?

487
00:33:56,003 --> 00:34:01,156
They are from the Deli
at Albertson's.

488
00:34:01,174 --> 00:34:04,176
Oh.

489
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:07,296
Oh. Well, uh,

490
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:10,800
Good-- good work
on your shopping then.

491
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:15,021
Because these are choice.

492
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:32,872
I, uh, I eat a lot
of frozen stuff.

493
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:35,858
It's usually pretty bad.

494
00:34:35,876 --> 00:34:38,411
I mean, the pictures are
always so awesome, you know?

495
00:34:38,462 --> 00:34:41,030
It's like, "hell yeah,
I'm stoked for this lasagna."

496
00:34:41,048 --> 00:34:44,867
And then you nuke it, and the
cheese gets all scabby on top,

497
00:34:44,885 --> 00:34:47,503
and it's like-- it's like
you're eating a scab.

498
00:34:47,537 --> 00:34:49,705
I mean, seriously,
what's that about?

499
00:34:49,723 --> 00:34:54,043
It's like, yo, whatever happened
to truth in advertising?

500
00:34:54,061 --> 00:34:56,879
You know?

501
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,608
Yeah, it's bad.

502
00:35:12,996 --> 00:35:16,115
So, hey, uh, how's business?

503
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:17,750
The car wash.

504
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:21,087
Mr. White said it's
going really well.

505
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:23,673
He was, like, you're a--
you're a great manager.

506
00:35:26,009 --> 00:35:27,677
He did, huh?

507
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:30,880
Yeah, he says you've
got it running like a--

508
00:35:30,914 --> 00:35:33,516
Like a machine.
Like, well-oiled.

509
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,185
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

510
00:35:39,272 --> 00:35:41,423
What else did he
tell you about me?

511
00:35:43,259 --> 00:35:46,112
Oh, you know, just...
Just good stuff.

512
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:48,647
Just really, you know,
really good, good stuff.

513
00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:50,449
Um, we don't really
talk that much

514
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:56,038
about, um, personal--
personal things.

515
00:35:56,073 --> 00:35:58,574
Hmm.

516
00:35:58,608 --> 00:36:02,444
Did you also tell him
about my affair?

517
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:23,632
May I please be excused?

518
00:36:38,749 --> 00:36:41,250
You know my kids are gone?
Thank God.

519
00:36:42,669 --> 00:36:46,372
No. I don't mean
they're out for the night.

520
00:36:46,423 --> 00:36:50,509
They're gone.
They're staying with my in-laws.

521
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:53,095
She made me kick my own kids
out of the house.

522
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:02,471
She told me

523
00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:04,974
that she was counting the days

524
00:37:05,008 --> 00:37:06,842
until my cancer came back.

525
00:37:10,781 --> 00:37:13,866
My wife is waiting
for me to die.

526
00:37:16,536 --> 00:37:19,538
This business is all
I have left now.

527
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:27,362
It's all I have.

528
00:37:31,201 --> 00:37:33,469
And you want to take
it away from me.

529
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:59,375
I thought you might
try something stupid.

530
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:01,961
- Look, Mike--
- Don't bother, Walter.

531
00:38:02,012 --> 00:38:04,297
Come join me in the office.

532
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,217
I don't think so.

533
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:10,803
That's not a request.

534
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:18,594
Might as well get comfortable.

535
00:38:18,612 --> 00:38:20,780
This deal's going down
tomorrow. It's happening,

536
00:38:20,814 --> 00:38:22,398
and there's nothing
you can do to stop it.

537
00:38:22,432 --> 00:38:25,117
- Got it?
- Oh, so it's okay for you to steal my--

538
00:38:25,152 --> 00:38:27,770
And to ensure that,
you and I are gonna spend

539
00:38:27,788 --> 00:38:30,790
the rest of the night
together in this office.

540
00:38:30,824 --> 00:38:33,292
- Like it's my birthday.
- Mike--

541
00:38:33,327 --> 00:38:36,278
When the deal is done, you'll get your money.
I guarantee that.

542
00:38:36,296 --> 00:38:40,616
Let me cook it. I'll double
your five and you still walk.

543
00:38:40,634 --> 00:38:44,620
You know, I have never seen anybody
work so hard not to get $5 million.

544
00:38:44,638 --> 00:38:45,954
Mike, you need to listen to me.

545
00:38:45,973 --> 00:38:48,924
No, Walter. The last thing
I need to do

546
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:51,627
is listen to you.
Now, sit down.

547
00:39:24,211 --> 00:39:25,845
All right.

548
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:28,664
Walter, I've got
a bit of a quandary here.

549
00:39:28,682 --> 00:39:30,516
I've got something
I need to attend to

550
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,501
before this deal happens.

551
00:39:32,552 --> 00:39:36,639
But for some reason, I don't trust
you alone with the methylamine.

552
00:39:37,724 --> 00:39:39,308
I'm gonna have to restrain you.

553
00:39:40,944 --> 00:39:42,695
You gotta be kidding.

554
00:39:42,729 --> 00:39:45,231
Stand up for me, please.

555
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:48,617
Stand up.

556
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:51,070
Turn around for me.

557
00:39:51,121 --> 00:39:52,688
Arms out to the side.

558
00:39:52,706 --> 00:39:54,523
Up.

559
00:40:09,056 --> 00:40:10,706
- Oh, man.
- Sit down.

560
00:40:12,976 --> 00:40:15,227
Sit down.

561
00:40:17,814 --> 00:40:19,849
Give me your wrist.

562
00:40:27,274 --> 00:40:28,691
Sorry.

563
00:43:18,912 --> 00:43:21,163
All righty. To what
do we owe the pleasure?

564
00:43:21,197 --> 00:43:25,501
Well, gentlemen, we're here to discuss
your illegal harassment of my client.

565
00:43:27,236 --> 00:43:28,337
This should be good.

566
00:43:28,371 --> 00:43:30,072
Mr. Ehrmantraut
has become the subject

567
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:32,074
of a vicious, relentless,

568
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:36,712
and unwarranted
DEA persecution.

569
00:43:36,746 --> 00:43:39,247
Gomie, does that, uh,
that sound right to you?

570
00:43:39,266 --> 00:43:41,383
I have no idea what
he's talking about.

571
00:43:41,417 --> 00:43:42,918
Play it as cool
as you like, Fonzie.

572
00:43:42,936 --> 00:43:46,605
But we all know you've been
following my client day and night.

573
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,191
The poor man can't even spend a few
minutes with his granddaughter

574
00:43:49,225 --> 00:43:51,727
without you guys quivering
in the bushes

575
00:43:51,761 --> 00:43:53,862
and peeping through
your little binoculars.

576
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:57,599
It's-- Well, it's disturbing.

577
00:43:57,617 --> 00:44:03,038
And it's taken a toll on his
mental and physical well-being.

578
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:05,407
Your client looks fine to me.

579
00:44:05,441 --> 00:44:09,962
Well, some hurts only show
on the inside.

580
00:44:09,996 --> 00:44:13,115
Now, you guys don't even have
warrants for these tails, do you?

581
00:44:13,133 --> 00:44:16,785
Theoretically, these tails
you refer to would be

582
00:44:16,803 --> 00:44:18,253
completely within the bounds
of the law.

583
00:44:18,287 --> 00:44:19,838
We don't need a warrant
to follow somebody

584
00:44:19,889 --> 00:44:21,307
through a public place.
Theoretically.

585
00:44:21,341 --> 00:44:25,094
Yeah, that is, uh,
theoretically correct.

586
00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:29,348
However, I would counter that an
open-ended, unrestricted surveillance

587
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:32,634
like this amounts to stalking.

588
00:44:32,652 --> 00:44:34,903
Which is illegal.

589
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:37,439
Now, I don't know what it is
you find so interesting

590
00:44:37,473 --> 00:44:40,159
about my client,
and I'm not here to judge.

591
00:44:40,193 --> 00:44:44,580
Different strokes and all.
But sadly, he's just not that into you.

592
00:44:44,614 --> 00:44:48,200
So, I have filed for a
temporary restraining order

593
00:44:48,251 --> 00:44:52,454
against the DEA on behalf
of Mr. Ehrmantraut.

594
00:44:54,924 --> 00:44:58,160
Where'd you get
your law degree, Goodman?

595
00:44:58,178 --> 00:45:00,679
The same clown college
you got that suit?

596
00:45:00,714 --> 00:45:02,097
You know who likes this suit?

597
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:05,684
Judge Papadoumian. She thinks
I'm a snappy dresser.

598
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:07,720
You know what
Judge Papadoumian hates?

599
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:12,191
Police harassment
of a senior citizen.

600
00:45:12,225 --> 00:45:14,109
Sorry.

601
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:15,978
Expect a visit
from the sheriff, agents.

602
00:45:16,012 --> 00:45:18,564
You should have
your <i>ex parte</i> within the hour.

603
00:45:20,533 --> 00:45:21,984
Let's go.

604
00:45:30,243 --> 00:45:31,877
<i>What the hell kind of
judge would issue this thing?</i>

605
00:45:31,911 --> 00:45:33,495
<i>Papadoumian, man.</i>

606
00:45:33,529 --> 00:45:35,998
<i>She's like Ho Chi Minh.</i>

607
00:45:36,032 --> 00:45:37,499
<i>So what we do?</i>

608
00:45:37,533 --> 00:45:40,803
<i>Well, not a lot of choice,</i>
<i>you know? We back off.</i>

609
00:45:40,837 --> 00:45:44,673
<i>For the moment. TRO won't stand
up, and Goodman knows it.</i>

610
00:45:44,707 --> 00:45:46,341
<i>I don't see what they're</i>
<i>playing at here,</i>

611
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:48,877
<i>but if Ehrmantraut</i>
<i>wants a fight,</i>

612
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,346
<i>he's gonna get one.</i>

613
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:52,848
That was a hell of a gamble.

614
00:45:52,882 --> 00:45:53,899
Worked.

615
00:45:53,933 --> 00:45:57,019
Yeah, well, not for long.

616
00:45:57,053 --> 00:46:00,489
He's right about that TRO.
It's gonna get tossed toute suite.

617
00:46:00,523 --> 00:46:03,992
Meanwhile, Schrader's hard-on for you
just reached Uncle Miltie proportions.

618
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:05,694
So have fun with that.

619
00:46:05,728 --> 00:46:08,580
How much time I got?

620
00:46:08,615 --> 00:46:11,333
Maybe 24 hours.

621
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:12,835
It's enough.

622
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:14,953
It better be.
Whatever you got planned,

623
00:46:15,004 --> 00:46:17,673
you best pull the ripcord
while you still have a chance.

624
00:46:31,604 --> 00:46:33,105
- Where is it?
- Mike--

625
00:46:33,139 --> 00:46:34,690
- Mike!
- Get out of my way.

626
00:46:34,724 --> 00:46:36,475
You, sit down.

627
00:46:36,526 --> 00:46:38,260
Mike! Mike!
Hold on, okay?

628
00:46:38,278 --> 00:46:40,446
- I am gonna count to three.
- Mr. White's got an idea.

629

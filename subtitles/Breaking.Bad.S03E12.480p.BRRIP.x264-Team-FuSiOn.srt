1
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,704
Hey, guys.

2
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:54,299
So if it's okay, I was thinking
about using this one for the test.

3
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,510
Mom's brakes are very sticky...

4
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:01,807
...and you barely press down on them
and it's like a screech.

5
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,142
Sure.

6
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,855
But I'm good?

7
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,316
Yeah, you're great. Why?

8
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,194
Are my feet okay?

9
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:24,580
I looked it up. New Mexico says
all I need is a note from a doctor.

10
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,332
I know it's not the right way and all...

11
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:31,712
...but once I get my provisional,
I can keep working at it.

12
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,800
Well, as long as it gets you safely
from point A to point B...

13
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,678
...then who am I to argue?

14
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,148
Hi.

15
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:56,111
You're a sweet girl. Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

16
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,365
I know.

17
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:16,924
- Here you go.
- Here you go.

18
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,801
- All right.
- Thank you.

19
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:21,637
- Got it?
- Yeah.

20
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,139
Okay. All right.

21
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:28,602
- So 9 a.m. Saturday?
- Yes, 9 a.m. Saturday.

22
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,979
So which means
pick me up about 8:30?

23
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,857
- I'll be here with bells on.
- What?

24
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,778
It's just a saying.
Don't worry, I won't be wearing bells.

25
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,905
- Hey.
- Hey, Mom.

26
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,949
- Hi. Do you have a minute?
- Yeah.

27
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,535
- Could you keep an eye on your sister?
- Sure.

28
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:45,994
- Thanks.
- See you, Dad.

29
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,872
- Bye, son. Hey, good work today.
- Thank you.

30
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:58,799
Have you thought anymore
about what we discussed?

31
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,387
"Thought anymore"
meaning reconsidered? No.

32
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,973
So show me the flaw in it.

33
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:11,436
Flaws, Skyler.
Flaws. Plural, not singular.

34
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,982
Where do you want me to start?

35
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:20,153
Hey, I don't love this situation,
all right, that you put me in.

36
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,867
However, let's just stick
with what makes sense here.

37
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,077
You took the money
you won gambling...

38
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,746
...invested it in the car wash
you helped run.

39
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:34,334
You hired your wife as a bookkeeper,
because she's actually a bookkeeper.

40
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,671
That is a story an auditor can believe.
What am I missing?

41
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,674
You should just take this money
that I give you...

42
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,968
...and not look too closely at it.

43
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:47,598
So, if God forbid, I get caught...

44
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,309
...you maintain plausible deniability.

45
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:54,313
Okay, my estranged husband who,
when he was working...

46
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:58,066
...made $43,000 a year,
starts shovelling money at me.

47
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,736
And when the police come,
I'm supposed to say:

48
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:04,406
"I never thought about it, officers.
Made sense to me". Really?

49
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:08,118
That, in your mind,
is plausible deniability?

50
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,037
I tell you what, Walt...

51
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:13,415
...I'd rather have them think
I'm Bonnie what's-her-name...

52
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,125
...than some complete idiot.

53
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:21,673
So you're promoting caution here.

54
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:26,094
And you want a believable story.

55
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:29,515
That, it seems to me,
is the safest way...

56
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:35,437
...to make the best
out of a very bad situation, yes.

57
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:42,110
But I'm noting a little hole
in your plot though.

58
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:46,281
Why would your estranged husband
be doing all this for you?

59
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:53,664
Because he loves his family and
desperately wants a reconciliation...

60
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:57,668
...though it may be hopeless
and futile.

61
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:02,214
Then again, he'd try anything.

62
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,137
I'm just not buying it.
No, I think it would be better...

63
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,599
...if the husband
were no longer estranged.

64
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:16,687
Yeah. Maybe if he were back
sleeping in his own bed.

65
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,984
And suddenly a fantasy story.

66
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:29,157
I am at least gonna be a part
of this household.

67
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,869
Dinner with the family
every night of the week.

68
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,662
Not every night, no.

69
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,082
Six nights a week. One night off.

70
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,626
Dinner two nights. Not weekends.

71
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,545
With 24-hours' notice.

72
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,630
Five nights a week, with no notice.

73
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,966
Three. Six-hours' notice.

74
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,844
- Five nights a week, two hours' notice.
- Four.

75
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:52,055
Don't push it.

76
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,268
- And I want my own key to the house.
- No.

77
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,770
For emergencies and appearances,
yes.

78
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,858
I am going to babysit my own daughter,
help my son with his homework.

79
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:08,864
I am going to be a part of this family.
That is how we'll sell your little fiction.

80
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:36,308
How about we stop somewhere
afterward and get a beer?

81
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:47,653
No. Thanks, though.
Maybe some other time.

82
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,113
Seriously.

83
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,574
Get a beer with me.

84
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,347
What?

85
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,482
What the hell are you doing?

86
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,901
That's ours, right?

87
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:31,530
Look at it and tell me if that's ours.

88
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:40,414
Yes, it's ours. Now put it away.

89
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:44,001
What the hell is wrong with you?

90
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,296
Where did you get that?
Did you take it from the lab?

91
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,716
I bought it from the two guys
who killed Combo.

92
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:54,511
They had Combo shot down
in the street...

93
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:58,056
...and now it's our product
they're selling.

94
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:01,560
Which means they work for our guy.
Right?

95
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:05,314
What? No. What is that?
That's hearsay. Do you have any proof?

96
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:09,902
I heard it from the sister
of the kid who shot him.

97
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:13,614
Hear how I just said "kid"?

98
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:17,826
This kid, he's 11 years old.

99
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:21,038
Shot Combo on orders.

100
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,791
These two scumbags,
they got him dealing.

101
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,710
They got him...

102
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,795
And you know he's not the first.

103
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:34,635
They use kids because hey, why not?
Easy to control. Easy to fool.

104
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,137
All they get is juvie
if they get caught.

105
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:39,765
Hearts and minds, right?

106
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,852
Get them young
and they're yours forever.

107
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,605
These guys killed Combo.

108
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:51,193
They used this little kid
like some puppet.

109
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:56,698
They used him to shoot my friend.

110
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:05,249
So why are you telling me this?

111
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,254
I need your help.

112
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,298
How?

113
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:16,802
- I need ricin.
- Oh, my God.

114
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:20,180
- Oh, my God.
- Look, these two...

115
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:21,431
- Hey.
- No.

116
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,561
Hey, they gotta go. All right?
I got the... entire thing figured out.

117
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,771
- No.
- The delivery method, everything.

118
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,275
All I need from you is the poison,
that's all.

119
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,735
- No...
- Look.

120
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,738
- Otherwise, you don't gotta lift a finger.
- No.

121
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,157
You don't know
what you're talking about.

122
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,369
- Not even...
- Look, you don't get how right this is?

123
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:46,790
You don't get how the whole
entire world would be better off?

124
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:48,542
We're not talking about this.

125
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,379
I know a woman who buys
from these two once or twice a week.

126
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:57,134
They sit in their car all day and they
get hungry, so she brings them food...

127
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,678
...and they knock a few bucks
off her price.

128
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,556
There's your delivery system
right there.

129
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:04,975
- I could be a mile away.
- Jesus.

130
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:07,853
A meth-head
you're trusting to do this?

131
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,273
Know what? That meth-head stood up
to your brother-in-law.

132
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:15,110
He questioned her for five hours.
She didn't give it up.

133
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:18,822
Know how you know?
Because you're not in prison right now.

134
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:21,491
Well, I know I would be in prison
after this.

135
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,828
Prison or worse.
And I'd be right alongside you.

136
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:27,831
No, Jesse, you cannot be serious.

137
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,126
This is a ridiculous idea.

138
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:35,005
It's ridiculous? What,
so you're saying it's not gonna work?

139
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:40,594
How about back when it was your plan?
When we were gonna use it on Tuco.

140
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,597
- Apples and oranges.
- Guy eats ricin...

141
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:48,393
...two or three days later he gets the flu
or a heart attack and he keels over.

142
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:51,980
That's what you said.
Untraceable back to us.

143
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:54,441
To me.

144
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:59,321
Not even that other scumbag
we work for is ever gonna figure it out.

145
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,867
It was a good plan back when
it was Tuco, and it's a good plan now.

146
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:09,414
Tuco wanted to murder us.
These guys don't.

147
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:14,419
Apples and oranges. Do I really have
to sit here and explain the difference?

148
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:18,715
Combo was us, man.

149
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:22,302
He was one of us.
Does that mean nothing?

150
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:26,723
Why didn't you go after these guys
two or three months ago?

151
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,976
Because I just found out about them.

152
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,644
What's to find out?

153
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:32,563
It's a dispute over turf, right?

154
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:37,776
I mean, how hard could it have been for
you to track them down on their turf...

155
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,737
...and kill them months ago?

156
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:46,869
Because back then, you were too busy
getting high, feeling sorry.

157
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:54,126
Now, murder is not part
of your 12-step programme.

158
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,671
This is not some amends
that you have to make.

159
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,466
What you are talking about here
is pointless.

160
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,220
This achieves nothing.

161
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,682
It accomplishes nothing.

162
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,190
If you don't see
what it accomplishes...

163
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,401
...then there's no way
I can explain it to you.

164
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:22,529
Jesse, listen to me.

165
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:26,116
You are not a murderer.

166
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,661
I'm not, and you're not.

167
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,915
It's as simple as that.

168
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,087
Jesse.

169
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:42,591
I'm doing it.

170
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:46,261
With or without you.

171
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,668
Knock, knock.

172
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,672
Chrissakes, Marie, you don't say
"knock, knock," you... like that.

173
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,716
- I like saying it.
- Well, that's not the rules.

174
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:28,220
- Okay?
- You knock your way, I'll knock mine.

175
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:30,430
But look, see? I win.

176
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,558
Not so fast.

177
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,769
Christ, again? That's three in a row.

178
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:38,480
Got a fricking Paul Newman
over here?

179
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:42,025
- Been playing cards with your dad?
- No. Why?

180
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,237
How is your old man?

181
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,655
Back teaching?

182
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:50,117
No. I don't think
either of them are working...

183
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,578
...right now.
- How they swinging that?

184
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,621
- I don't know.
- Hey...

185
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,541
...did you know
the doctors told your Uncle Hank...

186
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,043
...he can get out of here
anytime he wants?

187
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:02,462
Oh, yeah? That's great.

188
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:06,216
- Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.
- Why not?

189
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,427
What? That's what they said.

190
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,179
Because they want the room.

191
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:13,098
They hit the sheets with Lysol,
reset the meter...

192
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:17,019
...and wheel the next slob in.
We went over this, Marie. Drop it.

193
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:21,481
Are you not well enough?

194
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:25,819
Jesus, kid, you too?
Do I look well enough?

195
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,739
I'm shitting in pans,
peeing in pitchers.

196
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:31,617
I can't move my legs. Got it?

197
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:35,162
So people in wheelchairs
should be in hospitals?

198
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:40,083
What about people on crutches?
Maybe I should be in here too.

199
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:45,589
- Is that what you're trying to say?
- Exactly. Deal, you little prick.

200
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,151
Bitch.

201
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:10,030
You know I'm hourly, right?

202
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,034
He promised me
that he would be here.

203
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:15,827
Oh, he promised.

204
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:20,541
Why didn't you tell me? Let's wait then.
That's a joke. The kid ain't coming.

205
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:25,629
- Okay, so, what's plan B?
- I don't know.

206
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:29,132
- I really don't.
- Well, let's brainstorm.

207
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:33,512
- You really think he's serious?
- That's why I'm here, Saul.

208
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,308
The way he was talking,
he is going to do it. Or try, at least.

209
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:40,644
Okay, so we pay him off.

210
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:44,565
No, no, it's not about money.
It's about getting him off the streets.

211
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:47,442
Getting him to calm down.

212
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:49,570
Maybe...

213
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:57,119
What if we, maybe...?

214
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:00,998
Could you get him arrested?

215
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,879
You want your criminal associate
taken into police custody?

216
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,381
No, now listen.
I know it sounds risky.

217
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:13,093
But it wouldn't anything
that would get him into real trouble...

218
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:16,096
...and nothing that could lead back
to our business.

219
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:17,848
Just some minor offence.

220
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,893
Pinkman in jail? I don't know.
I'm picturing it and...

221
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:26,190
No, not jail as in "jail" jail.

222
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:29,193
I'm talking about
one of those situations...

223
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:33,572
...where you're in an orange jumpsuit
picking up litter along the highway.

224
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,991
That's jail.

225
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:39,494
You're talking about a level-two joint.

226
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:42,497
Something that keeps him off the street
for 30 days.

227
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,374
Then by the time he gets out...

228
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,377
...tempers have cooled
and hopefully we can move on.

229
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:51,465
Well, Roswell Correctional's
pretty low impact, you know.

230
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:54,635
In the past,
I've recommended Springer...

231
00:18:54,801 --> 00:19:00,057
...but I'm hearing chancy things about
their bathrooms since they renovated.

232
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,600
So...

233
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,977
So it's possible, right?

234
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:07,856
Well, it falls under
my Premium Services Package...

235
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:12,569
...but you can afford that.
I'll call my PI.

236
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:19,576
You understand what you have to do?

237
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:26,375
And you can never talk to anyone,
right?

238
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:31,630
I mean, ever. Understand?

239
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:33,465
Yeah.

240
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:40,055
I found this stuff on the Internet.

241
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:42,349
Takes days to kick in.

242
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:45,811
Just keep quiet
and this won't ever come back to you.

243
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,440
You okay with this, right?

244
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,404
Just think of it
like it's the same thing as always.

245
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:58,323
You're just delivering
some hamburgers.

246
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:04,079
It's not just delivering hamburgers.

247
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:09,126
Hey. You got a kid, right?

248
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:12,421
- What's his name?
- Patrick.

249
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:17,885
All right, imagine these two guys
had Patrick working as a mule.

250
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:19,970
Making him kill people.

251
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:23,056
Wouldn't you do anything
to protect your kid?

252
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:26,226
Of course, I would.
I do all kinds of things for him.

253
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,732
Okay, so...

254
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,694
...these guys are using kids like that.

255
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,740
They gotta go. Right?

256
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:47,706
Good.

257
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:56,798
Tomorrow.

258
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,426
I'll be in touch.

259
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:22,824
Yeah. I bet that tastes good, huh?

260
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,623
Hey.

261
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:32,334
Come here, baby.

262
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:36,547
Okay. Here we go.

263
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:39,091
Here we go.

264
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:53,981
What are you doing?
If you need to talk, use the phone.

265
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:57,276
This isn't a phone talk, Walter.

266
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:59,903
Your wife's out, right?

267
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:05,200
Isn't she something?

268
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:08,078
I got a granddaughter
a few years older.

269
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:10,831
What can I do for you?

270
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:14,543
Have a seat, Walter.

271
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:21,091
I spoke to Goodman about Pinkman
and this plan of yours.

272
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:27,306
- And?
- Well, I'm not gonna do it.

273
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:30,642
- Why?
- Because it's moronic.

274
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,979
Saul said you've done things
like this before.

275
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:38,108
- That's not the moronic part.
- Okay. So, what's the problem?

276
00:22:38,317 --> 00:22:41,320
The problem is
the boss wouldn't like it.

277
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:44,448
Saul?

278
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:48,952
My boss.

279
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:50,746
Your boss.

280
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:59,004
This is a professional courtesy.
No one knows I'm here. Understand?

281
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:02,508
But our employer would find out,
like always.

282
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:06,762
And if Pinkman were arrested,
he'd take it as a problem.

283
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:09,598
Walt...

284
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:13,227
...you got a good thing going here.
We all do.

285
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:16,271
You wanna risk it all on one junkie?

286
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,607
Now, I realise
you two have a history...

287
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:23,320
...but this kid's been on the bubble
a while now. It's a long time coming.

288
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:27,157
What is?

289
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:35,207
I used to be a beat cop,
a long time ago.

290
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:38,085
I'd get called on domestic disputes
all the time.

291
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:40,504
Hundreds, probably, over the years.

292
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:44,883
But there was this one guy, this one
piece of shit that I will never forget.

293
00:23:45,092 --> 00:23:49,096
Gordie. He looked like Bo Svenson.
You remember him?

294
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:52,182
<i>- Walking Tall?</i> You don't remember?
- No.

295
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:57,354
Anyway, big boy, 270, 280...

296
00:23:57,563 --> 00:24:01,733
...but his wife...
Or whatever she was... His lady...

297
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:04,987
...was real small. Like a bird.

298
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,781
Wrists like little branches.

299
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:12,452
Anyway, my partner and I'd
get called out there... every weekend...

300
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:15,122
...and one of us would
pull her aside and say:

301
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:18,000
"Come on, tonight's the night
we press charges."

302
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:21,253
This wasn't one of those
"deep down, he loves me" setups.

303
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:24,673
We got a lot of those, but not this.
This girl was scared.

304
00:24:24,882 --> 00:24:28,218
She wasn't gonna cross him.
No way, no how.

305
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:31,805
Nothing we could do but pass her
to the EMT's, put him a car...

306
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:34,683
...drive him downtown,
throw him in a drunk tank.

307
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:37,769
He sleeps it off,
next morning, out he goes.

308
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:39,188
Back home.

309
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,774
But one night...

310
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:47,154
...my partner's out sick,
and it's just me.

311
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:49,698
The call comes in
and it's the usual crap.

312
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:52,618
Broke her nose in the shower
kind of thing.

313
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:55,746
So I cuff him, put him in the car
and away we go.

314
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:58,957
Only that night...

315
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,919
...we're driving into town...

316
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:07,674
...and this sideways asshole is in
my back seat humming "Danny Boy."

317
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:12,221
And it just rubbed me wrong.

318
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:16,141
So instead of left, I go right,
out into nowhere.

319
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:20,354
And I kneel him down
and I put my revolver in his mouth...

320
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:26,568
...and I told him,
"This is it. This is how it ends."

321
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:29,863
And he's crying,
going to the bathroom all over himself.

322
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:32,449
Swearing to God
he's gonna leave her alone.

323
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:36,912
Screaming, much as you can
with a gun in your mouth.

324
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:39,915
And I told him to be quiet.

325
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:43,293
That I needed to think
about what I was gonna do here.

326
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:46,213
And, of course, he got quiet...

327
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:51,552
...goes still and real quiet.

328
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:55,889
Like a dog waiting for dinner scraps.

329
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:59,017
Then we just stood there for a while.

330
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:02,938
Me, acting like
I'm thinking things over...

331
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:07,818
...and Prince Charming kneeling
in the dirt with shit in his pants.

332
00:26:10,112 --> 00:26:14,032
And after a few minutes,
I took the gun out of his mouth...

333
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:17,953
...and I say, "So help me,
if you ever touch her again...

334
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:23,333
...I will such and such and such,
and blah, blah, blah."

335
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:30,340
It was just a warning?

336
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:35,220
Of course.

337
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:40,309
Just trying to do the right thing.

338
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,898
But two weeks later he killed her.

339
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:48,442
Of course.

340
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:53,655
Caved her head in
with the base of a Waring blender.

341
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:59,912
We got there, there was so much blood,
you could taste the metal.

342
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:06,126
Moral of the story is...

343
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:09,963
...I chose a half measure...

344
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,091
...when I should have
gone all the way.

345
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:20,807
I'll never make that mistake again.

346
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:32,819
No more half measures, Walter.

347
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:52,297
Man, I don't get this.

348
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:56,343
I don't get this at all.
All I'm seeing is the kid.

349
00:27:57,803 --> 00:27:59,721
So where are they?

350
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:03,058
I don't know. They're always around.

351
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,144
Burgers are getting cold.

352
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:11,650
So is it, like, fast?

353
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,531
Don't sweat it.
You're just doing what you do.

354
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:20,409
Hey, nobody's gonna know anything.

355
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:24,913
- Can I have another bump?
- Look, you had your bump.

356
00:28:25,122 --> 00:28:28,041
Get this thing done,
then you can have all you want.

357
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,335
Gonna need you to come with me.

358
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:33,213
Take a walk.

359
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:13,754
Where we going?

360
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,265
Sit down.

361
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:03,030
I understand that you have a problem
with two of my employees.

362
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:07,075
It is true that they killed
one of your associates.

363
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:09,661
It is possible they acted rashly.

364
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:13,081
But, on the other hand,
there was provocation.

365
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,626
The man was selling
on their territory.

366
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,422
There is blame on both sides.

367
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:27,346
This will go no further.

368
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:31,934
It will be settled right here,
right now.

369
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:35,062
You told him?

370
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:39,816
Wait outside.

371
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:56,124
Listen to me. You have one friend
in this room. This man.

372
00:31:58,126 --> 00:32:02,548
Those men outside
are my trusted employees.

373
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:07,135
And when I learned
what you intended to do...

374
00:32:08,804 --> 00:32:12,558
If it wasn't for this man
and the respect I have for him...

375
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:16,228
...I would be dealing with this
in a very different way.

376
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:19,731
You don't look at him.
You look at me.

377
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:29,408
This is what happens now.
My men will come back inside...

378
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:34,121
...and you will shake their hands
and you will make peace.

379
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:36,874
And that will be the... end of this.

380
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:41,879
No.

381
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,174
Jesse.

382
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:49,052
- Pardon me?
- They use kids.

383
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:53,015
These assholes got an 11 -year-old kid
doing their killing for them.

384
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:56,435
You're supposed to be some kind
of a reasonable businessman.

385
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:58,729
This how you do business?

386
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:04,359
You okay with this?
You got anything to say here?

387
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:20,292
Bring them back.

388
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:46,235
No more children.

389
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:50,531
Understand?

390
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:54,326
And you...

391
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:00,624
...you keep the peace.

392
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:07,005
Say it.

393
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:11,802
Yeah. I'll keep the peace.

394
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:16,598
Shake hands.

395
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:03,270
Jesse, your actions...

396
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:07,733
...they affect other people.

397
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:15,407
Sometimes
compromises have to be made...

398
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,620
...for the best of reasons.

399
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:34,009
Jesse. Jesse.

400
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:57,783
Marie, let the people
who get paid to do this do this.

401
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:01,036
The people who get paid to do this
do a lousy job.

402
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:15,843
So I guess this is what you want,
huh?

403
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:20,973
Just lying in a hospital bed
getting sponge baths from nurses.

404
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:22,808
Marie.

405
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:26,895
It's time to go home, Hank.

406
00:36:27,104 --> 00:36:30,774
How many times I gotta tell you, Marie?
Not till I'm well.

407
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:40,075
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?

408
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:41,660
I'm just seeing.

409
00:36:41,827 --> 00:36:45,539
- Seeing what?
- Seeing what I see.

410
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:50,586
- I'm not at my best here, Marie.
- We'll see.

411
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:53,130
Nothing's gonna happen.

412
00:36:53,547 --> 00:36:54,548
I say it will.

413
00:36:54,756 --> 00:36:58,594
No. I'm in this bed for a reason.

414
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:02,347
It's a waste of time.

415
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:06,560
Besides, what if someone comes in?

416
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:10,063
- I don't care if someone walks in.
- What's wrong with you?

417
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:15,152
I'll tell you what. If I can get
the groundhog to see his shadow...

418
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,862
Not gonna happen. I'm sorry.

419
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:21,408
I'm betting it will.
And if he does, you check out of here.

420
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:26,079
I'm not gonna bet
on whether I can get a boner.

421
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:29,458
- No bet. There's no bet here. No bet.
- Afraid you'll lose?

422
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:33,337
You know, you're just...
You're just being foolish, you know?

423
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:36,465
Come on. What's the point?

424
00:37:36,632 --> 00:37:40,260
The point is
you're not completely hopeless.

425
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:46,016
We have a bet?

426
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:48,560
You know what?

427
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:51,897
If it'll get you out of here quicker.
You got one minute.

428
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:53,106
- One minute?
- Yeah.

429
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:54,983
All right. That's a cakewalk.

430
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:57,027
You know, this is just...

431
00:37:57,236 --> 00:37:59,154
This is just sad. I mean...

432
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:04,368
I really feel sorry for you,
Marie, you know? I really do. It's just...

433
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,120
- It's pathetic.
- That's good, keep talking.

434
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:10,499
Protest. Struggle.

435
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:14,795
Marie, give up.
I mean, seriously, it's...

436
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:17,214
...not...

437
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:19,299
...gonna happen.

438
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:46,410
Bad day?

439
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:51,290
I don't even know.

440
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:56,420
Anyway...

441
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:59,006
...it's better now.

442
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:08,140
Tell them you're busy.

443
00:39:10,726 --> 00:39:12,436
Hello?

444
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:14,897
Grandma?

445
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:17,065
Slow down.

446
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:19,610
Slow down, I can't...

447
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,071
Oh, God.

448
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,991
Oh, God.

449
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:31,538
Oh, God.

450
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:01,360
Tomas!

451
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:03,779
No.

452
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:07,407
You have to let me in. Please.

453
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:20,838
<i>Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.</i>

454
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:25,843
Jesse, you are now 42 minutes late.

455
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:29,847
I'm starting without you.

456
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:36,478
<i>- What is "wasabi"?</i>
<i>- Wasabi. Right you are.</i>

457
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:38,021
<i>Four-letter word, 1200.</i>

458
00:40:38,647 --> 00:40:41,358
<i>Pilots and musicians</i>
<i>know this word derives from...</i>

459
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:43,402
Dinner's almost ready, okay?

460
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,279
Okay.

461
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:48,365
<i>- What is "solo"?</i>
- This guy's good.

462
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:49,825
<i>Four letter word, 2000.</i>

463
00:40:49,992 --> 00:40:54,413
<i>"A loud, harsh cry;</i>
<i>Walt Whitman's was barbaric."</i>

464
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:56,582
- "Yell."
- What is "yawp"?

465
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,000
<i>- Kevin.</i>
<i>- What is "yawp"?</i>

466
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:00,127
<i>- Yawp.</i>
<i>- Tokyo, 1200.</i>

- <i>This crustacean...</i>
- What the heck's a yawp?

468
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:07,676
A yawp is a yell. I'll be right back.

469
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:10,387
That's what I said.

470
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:14,600
Okay to use your bathroom, right?

471
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,394
Yeah, okay.

472
00:41:26,278 --> 00:41:29,448
<i>Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.</i>

473
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:43,670
<i>Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.</i>

474
00:41:44,755 --> 00:41:49,801
Look, I hope you're not waiting for an
apology because I did not rat you out.

475
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:53,305
I was looking out for
your best interests, as well as my own.

476
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:55,682
And I stand by my decision
100 percent...

477
00:41:55,891 --> 00:41:59,728
...so we'll just have to agree
to disagree.

478
00:42:01,313 --> 00:42:04,608
Anyway, just call me back.

479
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:09,446
- So the TV turns itself off, huh?
- Yeah.

480
00:42:09,655 --> 00:42:11,198
I'll get it.

481
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:15,452
<i>- The beginning of an early cold snap.</i>
<i>But first, more details on...</i>

482
00:42:15,661 --> 00:42:17,120
Where's the remote?

483
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:19,998
<i>The murder of a young boy</i>
<i>in the South Valley.</i>

484
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:22,376
<i>Police have yet</i>
<i>to release a statement...</i>

485
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:25,712
<i>...but sources indicate</i>
<i>that 11-year-old Tomas Cantillo...</i>

486
00:42:25,921 --> 00:42:28,924
<i>...may have been the victim</i>
<i>of a gang-related execution.</i>

487
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:31,802
<i>An anonymous tip brought police</i>
<i>to a playground...</i>

488
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:35,013
<i>...in the 4700 block of Eighth Avenue</i>
<i>late last night.</i>

489
00:42:35,222 --> 00:42:39,101
<i>Paramedics were called to the scene</i>
<i>but were unable to revive the boy.</i>

490
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:42,104
<i>- A gruesome crime...</i>
- Can you turn that off?

491
00:42:42,312 --> 00:42:44,690
<i>Yet another casualty</i>
<i>in what appears to be...</i>

492
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:47,025
<i>...the city's ongoing struggle...</i>
- Walt?

493
00:42:47,234 --> 00:42:50,904
<i>...against drugs and the gangs</i>
<i>that peddle them. We'll be passing...</i>

494
00:42:57,202 --> 00:42:59,162
Hand me your dad...

495
00:42:59,621 --> 00:43:04,334
I'm sorry, it's just they've been talking
about that all day, and it's just...

496
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:06,461
No. Yeah.

497
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:12,467
Hey, did you know your Dad and I...

498
00:43:12,676 --> 00:43:15,554
...are thinking about
starting a business together?

499
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:17,723
Seriously?

500
00:43:18,098 --> 00:43:20,642
What kind of business?

501
00:43:21,018 --> 00:43:22,895
We're thinking maybe a car wash.

502
00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:25,147
What do you mean? Like the...?

503
00:43:27,649 --> 00:43:30,027
I'm sorry, I have to go.

504
00:46:07,935 --> 00:46:09,061
Oh, my God.

505
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:29,164
Run.

1
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,102
They're here.
They're out front.

2
00:00:34,136 --> 00:00:35,137
- How many?
- Four.

3
00:00:35,173 --> 00:00:36,507
Nelson Brey, three others.

4
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:38,044
- Did you get his toothbrush?
- Got it.

5
00:00:38,078 --> 00:00:40,248
What about your stuff?
Oh, you know what?

6
00:00:40,284 --> 00:00:43,158
We'll talk to them about
stopping at your place.

7
00:00:43,193 --> 00:00:45,029
Skyler- Skyler...

8
00:00:45,064 --> 00:00:46,366
- What?
- I'm not going.

9
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:47,638
What?

10
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,109
I'm not going
to Hank and Marie's.

11
00:00:49,143 --> 00:00:50,144
I'm not going anywhere.

12
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:51,281
But you said we're in danger.

13
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:52,519
Yes, that's true.

14
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,122
- Because of me.
- It doesn't matter now.

15
00:00:54,157 --> 00:00:55,525
All that matters is-

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,396
All that matters is that
the rest of you are safe,

17
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,235
and that's why
I'm not going with you.

18
00:01:00,406 --> 00:01:01,742
I'm the real target.

19
00:01:01,776 --> 00:01:03,647
But we'll all be safer
at Hank's.

20
00:01:03,681 --> 00:01:05,017
- That's-
- No, no, no.

21
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:07,857
No one will be safe
at Hank's if I'm there.

22
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:09,661
Walt, it's DEA.

23
00:01:10,898 --> 00:01:13,068
Skyler, you don't know
these people.

24
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:14,672
- I-
- No, Skyler, please,

25
00:01:14,705 --> 00:01:15,874
trust me.

26
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,344
This is how it has to be.

27
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:19,282
Walt, those agents
outside-

28
00:01:19,317 --> 00:01:21,019
they're not going
to just leave you here!

29
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:22,391
It's called protective custody.

30
00:01:22,424 --> 00:01:24,830
All they know is that
Hank is the only person

31
00:01:24,863 --> 00:01:26,701
that's in danger.

32
00:01:26,735 --> 00:01:29,005
They're including us only
as a courtesy to Marie,

33
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,142
just to keep her happy.

34
00:01:30,176 --> 00:01:31,545
How am I supposed
to explain that to Marie-

35
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:35,690
or Junior or Hank,
for that matter?

36
00:01:35,724 --> 00:01:38,162
I don't know, but you'll do it.

37
00:01:38,196 --> 00:01:39,566
You'll figure it out.

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,442
Hank knows that Marie
will be overreacting.

39
00:01:44,947 --> 00:01:46,250
Except she's not.

40
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,296
I'll talk to Hank.

41
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,034
You just back me up
with everyone else.

42
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:54,338
You really expect me to say

43
00:01:54,372 --> 00:01:56,676
"Okay, Walt, sure,
just stay here and... "

44
00:01:58,448 --> 00:02:01,889
No, there's got to be
another way.

45
00:02:03,025 --> 00:02:04,193
There isn't.

46
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:06,901
There was,

47
00:02:06,935 --> 00:02:08,938
but now there isn't.

48
00:02:12,014 --> 00:02:14,150
Walt,

49
00:02:14,186 --> 00:02:16,455
how long till you're safe,

50
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:17,892
till you can work this out?

51
00:02:22,138 --> 00:02:23,373
Oh, Skyler...

52
00:02:26,415 --> 00:02:27,919
- Skyler-

53
00:02:27,953 --> 00:02:32,630
I have lived under the threat
of death for a year now,

54
00:02:32,665 --> 00:02:35,839
and because of that,

55
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:36,974
I've made choices.

56
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:39,415
- Walt-
- Listen to me.

57
00:02:39,448 --> 00:02:42,790
I alone should suffer
the consequences

58
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:44,794
of those choices, no one else.

59
00:02:45,797 --> 00:02:47,266
And those consequences-

60
00:02:48,938 --> 00:02:50,775
they're coming.

61
00:02:53,917 --> 00:02:56,288
No more prolonging
the inevitable.

62
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,050
Feed that belt- yep, right
through those seatbelt holders

63
00:03:08,084 --> 00:03:09,487
- Thank you so much.
- Hank,

64
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:11,024
I've got a car wash to run.

65
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:12,763
I mean,
you don't honestly believe

66
00:03:12,797 --> 00:03:15,134
that I'm in danger,
do you? Me?

67
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:16,739
<i>Oh, Jesus,</i>

68
00:03:16,772 --> 00:03:18,576
everything's going to go
over like a lead balloon.

69
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:19,980
It'll be Marie who kills me.

70
00:03:20,015 --> 00:03:21,350
<i>All right, well, just know</i>

71
00:03:21,385 --> 00:03:23,824
that I'll get there
as soon as I can,

72
00:03:23,857 --> 00:03:26,096
and let Steve Gomez know.

73
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:29,203
I told some of his guys,
and just stay safe.

74
00:03:29,237 --> 00:03:30,473
<i>Oh, please.</i>

75
00:03:30,507 --> 00:03:32,478
Whole thing's
just a giant jerk-off.

76
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:37,190
Yeah, yeah, but keep your head
down anyway, all right?

77
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:38,827
<i>All right.</i>

78
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:41,199
All right, buddy, take care.

79
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:49,253
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

80
00:03:51,327 --> 00:03:52,362
I know.

81
00:03:58,411 --> 00:03:59,645
Shh, shh, shh...

82
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:19,658
Okay, my love. We're okay.

83
00:04:24,604 --> 00:04:26,208
Okay, my darling.
It's okay.

84
00:04:27,378 --> 00:04:30,418
Okay...

86
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,473
He's going to risk
his life over a stupid car wash?

87
00:06:57,508 --> 00:06:59,244
Does he even understand

88
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:00,380
what's going on
with Uncle Hank?

89
00:07:00,414 --> 00:07:02,084
He'll come when he's able.

90
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,521
That's pathetic.

91
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:07,596
How hard did you even try,
or did you?

92
00:07:07,632 --> 00:07:10,336
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Lay off your mom.

93
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:11,773
Well, you know, Hank, we wouldn't
even be arguing about this

94
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:15,482
if you and Steve
would just make him come.

95
00:07:15,516 --> 00:07:16,919
Why didn't your people
put him in the car?

96
00:07:16,953 --> 00:07:19,024
Uh, because it's not
Nazi German, all right?

97
00:07:19,058 --> 00:07:20,861
Oh, pl- you-
Nazi Germany.

98
00:07:20,895 --> 00:07:23,066
If I had a dollar
for every time I heard that.

99
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:24,937
You know what?
I'm going to call him.

100
00:07:24,972 --> 00:07:27,776
He's going to get
his behind here immediately.

101
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:29,381
End of story.

102
00:07:29,414 --> 00:07:31,886
Thank you. At least somebody
is listening to me.

103
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,991
Because we are all
in danger here.

104
00:07:34,026 --> 00:07:35,428
We are not all in danger.

105
00:07:35,462 --> 00:07:36,831
Will you stop saying that?

106
00:07:36,865 --> 00:07:39,638
That is asking for trouble.

107
00:07:39,672 --> 00:07:41,843
Oh, come on, Walt.

108
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,860
He's not picking up.

109
00:07:48,894 --> 00:07:50,563
Look, could we just take
this down a notch?

110
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:52,133
Okay, everybody?

111
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:54,806
Sky, you guys can stay here
as long as you like, okay?

112
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,010
We've got plenty of room.

113
00:07:56,044 --> 00:07:57,145
But I wouldn't worry

114
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,151
about any danger to Walt
or any of us.

115
00:07:59,184 --> 00:08:00,921
Okay?

116
00:08:00,956 --> 00:08:03,962
This whole thing's
just a damn smoke screen.

117
00:08:03,997 --> 00:08:05,833
How do you mean
a- a smoke screen?

118
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:07,773
An anonymous threat against me?

119
00:08:07,806 --> 00:08:10,713
I'm stuck in a wheelchair.
I'm not even on the job.

120
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:14,757
No, someone doesn't like the way
I've been spending my free time.

121
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,762
What, minerals?

122
00:08:20,338 --> 00:08:22,744
Timing seem a bit odd
to you, huh?

123
00:08:22,777 --> 00:08:24,481
I mean, I start looking
into, you know...

124
00:08:27,055 --> 00:08:28,523
Fring, and all of a sudden
I'm under lockdown for my own protection?

125
00:08:28,557 --> 00:08:30,494
Wait a minute.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

126
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:32,030
Gus Fring?

127
00:08:32,065 --> 00:08:33,434
From the chicken restaurant?

128
00:08:33,468 --> 00:08:35,204
Hank, what are
you talking about?

129
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:38,947
Just one man's humble opinion.

130
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,216
That's all,

131
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:42,154
but I think Los Pollos Hermanos

132
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,160
is a front for the biggest
meth distributor

133
00:08:44,194 --> 00:08:45,196
in the Southwest.

134
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,234
- Oh, my God.
- Steve...

135
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:49,840
- Oh, my God.
Are you- Are you even looking into this?

136
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,076
We're looking
into everything,

137
00:08:51,112 --> 00:08:53,416
but we work on fact,
not conjecture,

138
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:54,853
and the fact is

139
00:08:54,888 --> 00:08:56,692
that the scumbags
that hit you first

140
00:08:56,725 --> 00:08:57,961
were Mexican cartel,

141
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:01,069
not some German multinational
whatever,

142
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:03,140
and definitely
not Colonel Sanders.

143
00:09:03,174 --> 00:09:05,479
Now, if we even had
a shred of proof-

144
00:09:05,513 --> 00:09:07,717
Isn't that what you
get paid to go get?

145
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:10,991
Remember that laundry
I told you about?

146
00:09:11,027 --> 00:09:12,796
I'd start there.

147
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,199
Come on, man.

148
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:16,237
It's a perfect spot
for a meth superlab.

149
00:09:16,271 --> 00:09:17,407
Oh, my God.

150
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,945
Hey,

151
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,217
what if I'm right?

152
00:09:22,251 --> 00:09:23,620
Even if you were right-

153
00:09:23,655 --> 00:09:25,257
and you ain't-

154
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:27,195
but if you were,
there's no way in hell

155
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,599
a judge is going to give me
a search warrant-

156
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:29,835
Search warrant?

157
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,275
What happened to good,
old-fashioned knock and talk?

158
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:34,780
Oh, that's right. I forgot.

159
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:37,187
You were never very good
at those, were you?

160
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:11,271
- Can I help you?
- Yes, sir.

161
00:10:11,304 --> 00:10:14,145
My friend and I- we wondered
if we could take a look around.

162
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:15,481
Why?

163
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:17,553
- Sorry, what's your name?
- Dennis.

164
00:10:17,587 --> 00:10:18,856
Dennis. Hey, I'm Steve Gomez.

165
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,562
I'm with the DEA,
Drug Enforcement.

166
00:10:21,597 --> 00:10:23,032
What, is there-
there a problem?

167
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:24,702
Not for you.
No, no problem.

168
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:26,039
We're just wondering if we
could take a look around.

169
00:10:26,073 --> 00:10:27,074
I, uh-

170
00:10:28,813 --> 00:10:29,947
Can I tell you a story?

171
00:10:30,951 --> 00:10:32,621
- Yeah.
- I bust this chef.

172
00:10:32,655 --> 00:10:33,924
Well, he says he's a chef,

173
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,461
but just because you work
at a restaurant

174
00:10:35,495 --> 00:10:37,499
that charges $14 for a burger,

175
00:10:37,532 --> 00:10:39,036
that don't make you a chef.

176
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,509
That makes you
a glorified burger flipper,

177
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:42,711
at least in my book.

178
00:10:42,746 --> 00:10:44,115
- Yeah.
- Anyway,

179
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:46,487
so we bust this chef-
heroin possession.

180
00:10:46,523 --> 00:10:48,392
He says, "Well, just
because you found heroin

181
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:51,167
"in my chef whites
doesn't make it mine. "

182
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:52,637
Maybe it came from the place

183
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:55,144
that launders my chef
whites"- this place.

184
00:10:55,177 --> 00:10:57,181
Oh, come on, man. I don't want
to do this stuff with you.

185
00:10:57,217 --> 00:10:58,619
I- I know, I know.

186
00:10:58,654 --> 00:11:00,457
You don't have to say it.
I'll say it for you.

187
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:03,464
His story is a big load
of steaming horse shit.

188
00:11:03,498 --> 00:11:05,602
I mean, we're going to
find heroin here

189
00:11:05,637 --> 00:11:08,542
like we're going to find
Jimmy Hoffa. Right?

190
00:11:08,577 --> 00:11:11,015
The thing is,
is that the chef's daddy

191
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,253
is a United States Senator.

192
00:11:13,288 --> 00:11:14,790
I'm not going to tell you
which one,

193
00:11:14,825 --> 00:11:16,495
but you probably know
who he is, right?

194
00:11:16,528 --> 00:11:18,599
So now I've got to waste
my time

195
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:21,072
checking out
this burger flipper's story,

196
00:11:21,106 --> 00:11:23,444
and if I don't, his old man's
going to jam me up,

197
00:11:23,478 --> 00:11:26,352
my ASAC,
my whole entire office.

198
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,157
Politics, huh?

199
00:11:28,191 --> 00:11:29,427
So what do you think?

200
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,331
Listen, you know what?

201
00:11:31,365 --> 00:11:33,068
I have to check with my boss,
and he's out of town,

202
00:11:33,104 --> 00:11:35,676
and I can't promise I'll reach him
anytime soon either, you know?

203
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,847
Well, yeah, that's probably
the way to go,

204
00:11:37,882 --> 00:11:39,485
so I'll have to go get
a warrant,

205
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,155
and we'll do it official,

206
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,094
but you're probably going to
have to close down for the day.

207
00:11:43,128 --> 00:11:44,230
What-? Why?

208
00:11:44,264 --> 00:11:46,167
Twenty agents poking around?

209
00:11:46,202 --> 00:11:47,572
Come on, it'll be less trouble

210
00:11:47,605 --> 00:11:48,774
if it was just us two,

211
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,946
but your call.

212
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:57,763
Just the two of you?

213
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,134
You'll make it quick, right?

214
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:01,973
Dennis, we'll be like the wind.

215
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:04,246
O- Okay.

216
00:12:04,281 --> 00:12:06,452
- Could you tell him?
- Okay.

217
00:12:06,486 --> 00:12:08,122
Okay.

218
00:12:16,644 --> 00:12:19,283
Oh, and, Dennis, can you clear
out some of your people for us?

219
00:12:19,317 --> 00:12:20,820
Confuses the dog's nose.

220
00:13:30,521 --> 00:13:34,431
So how long we
gotta be quiet down here?

221
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:42,149
Then what happens after this,

222
00:13:42,182 --> 00:13:45,924
provided they don't find their
way in here and bust our asses?

223
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,996
I'm gonna be, like, stuck
down here in a laundry hamper

224
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:50,835
for the rest of eternity?

225
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,408
No, I'm going on record.

226
00:13:53,443 --> 00:13:55,212
This- This blows.

227
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:01,629
Hello.

228
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:07,776
For you.

229
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,666
Yeah?

230
00:14:17,701 --> 00:14:20,272
<i>Do you know
what's happening upstairs?</i>

231
00:14:20,307 --> 00:14:22,478
I have a pretty good idea.

232
00:14:22,512 --> 00:14:26,387
This is all the result
of your former partner.

233
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:28,627
Do you understand now?

234
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:31,299
<i>Do you see
why this can't continue?</i>

235
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:34,207
You know, I get it.

236
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,012
The guy's a complete
and total dick,

237
00:14:36,045 --> 00:14:38,082
but I can't-

238
00:14:40,523 --> 00:14:42,526
I'm not signing off.

239
00:14:42,561 --> 00:14:45,534
<i>Okay?</i>

240
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:47,939
Like I said,

241
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:52,216
if something final

242
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,758
happens to Mr. White,

243
00:14:55,793 --> 00:14:57,429
we are going to have a problem.

244
00:15:02,877 --> 00:15:04,280
<i>So what are you going to do?</i>

245
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,863
There will be
an appropriate response.

246
00:15:10,896 --> 00:15:13,169
<i>Appropriate, what does that mean?</i>

247
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,439
Hello?

248
00:15:51,892 --> 00:15:53,328
They're gone.

249
00:15:54,532 --> 00:15:56,034
We're good.

250
00:17:09,443 --> 00:17:10,679
<i>You have reached Walter White.</i>

251
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:12,215
<i>At the tone,
please state your name,</i>

252
00:17:12,249 --> 00:17:13,953
<i>number, and the reason
for your call.</i>

253
00:17:13,987 --> 00:17:15,055
<i>Thank you.</i>

254
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,917
<i>You have six new messages.</i>

255
00:17:40,952 --> 00:17:42,421
<i>Hey, kid, it's me, Goodman.</i>

256
00:17:42,455 --> 00:17:43,991
<i>Give me a call, would you?</i>

257
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,237
<i>Hey, need to hear from you.
All right?</i>

258
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,940
<i>Hope I made myself clear
about that.</i>

259
00:17:50,975 --> 00:17:53,714
<i>Call me as soon as you can.</i>

260
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:57,789
<i>Pinkman, get over here.
Stat, pronto.</i>

261
00:17:57,824 --> 00:17:59,327
<i>Don't call.
Just get over here.</i>

262
00:17:59,362 --> 00:18:00,396
<i>Would you just...?
Please.</i>

263
00:18:01,969 --> 00:18:04,340
<i>I don't know if I'm
speaking English here-</i>

264
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:09,484
What's up?
He's waiting for me, yo.

265
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,455
Hold up, hold up.

266
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,826
The hell, man?

267
00:18:12,861 --> 00:18:14,029
Get off of me!

268
00:18:14,063 --> 00:18:15,933
Hey, Goodman!
Get out here!

269
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:17,403
Get- Hey!

270
00:18:17,437 --> 00:18:18,873
Yo, get your goon off me.

271
00:18:18,907 --> 00:18:21,145
Not him, moron. Drop.
Leave it. Go lie down.

272
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,583
Sorry, you can't
be too careful these days.

273
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:26,357
Come on, come on.
Lock the door, frisky.

274
00:18:26,392 --> 00:18:27,393
Jesus.

275
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,240
Take a break, H.T. Let's go.

276
00:18:33,274 --> 00:18:34,509
You're going to stop
calling me that,

277
00:18:34,545 --> 00:18:36,248
or I'm going to hang you
by your tie.

278
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,721
Yeah, yeah, stop showing off
for the client.

279
00:18:38,756 --> 00:18:41,060
Honey Tits.
I say it's endearing.

280
00:18:42,865 --> 00:18:45,738
So what's so important?

281
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:46,975
Well, they're here-

282
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,378
the end times, kid.

283
00:18:48,412 --> 00:18:49,781
End times.

284
00:18:49,816 --> 00:18:51,218
What's that mean?

285
00:18:51,252 --> 00:18:52,721
And why the hell you drag
me down here for?

286
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,559
You want your money, don't you?

287
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:56,396
I assume that you do.

288
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,967
What, that couldn't wait?

289
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,438
You ever hear the expression
"a fart in the wind," kid?

290
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,576
Well, inside of an hour,
that's going to be me, okay?

291
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,882
I'm hitting the road.
I'm gone. I'm out of here.

292
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,054
What, for, like, good?

293
00:19:07,088 --> 00:19:08,491
For as long as it takes.

294
00:19:08,526 --> 00:19:11,098
I don't like my heat so hot,
if you catch my drift.

295
00:19:11,132 --> 00:19:13,571
I'm not catching, like,
anything you're saying,

296
00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:14,841
and what the hell
is your problem?

297
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,778
You haven't talked
to your partner, have you?

298
00:19:16,814 --> 00:19:18,584
No, not since last night.

299
00:19:18,618 --> 00:19:20,456
Today he didn't show up
to work,

300
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,861
and the DEA just happened
to, like, raid us.

301
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:27,072
Yeah, some coincidence, huh?

302
00:19:27,106 --> 00:19:28,575
Yeah, I don't know about that.

303
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,881
All I know is when he tells me

304
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,820
that your employer
took him out in the desert

305
00:19:32,854 --> 00:19:34,423
and threatened to murder
his entire family,

306
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,693
I sit up and take notice

307
00:19:35,728 --> 00:19:38,232
because, hey, after all,
what am I if not family?

308
00:19:38,268 --> 00:19:39,970
What are you-
What are you talking about?

309
00:19:40,005 --> 00:19:41,307
When did that happen?

310
00:19:43,013 --> 00:19:44,714
I don't know. Forget it.

311
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,221
He- He exaggerates, right?
He does that.

312
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:49,226
Hey, listen, do me a favor.

313
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,365
Would you put in a good word
for me with Fring?

314
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:54,807
I mean,
just for old time's sake.

315
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,681
I can't afford to butter
the wrong bread here.

316
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:01,457
Yeah.

317
00:20:29,993 --> 00:20:32,733
Hey.

318
00:20:35,405 --> 00:20:36,841
Nothing, huh?

319
00:20:36,876 --> 00:20:38,312
Clean as a whistle,

320
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:40,216
so he says.

321
00:20:58,826 --> 00:21:00,060
<i>You have reached Walter White.</i>

322
00:21:00,095 --> 00:21:01,597
<i>At the tone,
please state your name,</i>

323
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:03,336
<i>number, and the reason
for your call.</i>

324
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,438
<i>Thank you.</i>

325
00:21:06,211 --> 00:21:08,481
It's me again.

326
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:09,986
I really wish you'd pick up.

327
00:21:14,097 --> 00:21:16,770
God, I just-

328
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:20,111
Call me back, okay?

329
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:23,721
Just- Just call me back,
please.

330
00:21:41,396 --> 00:21:45,171
Hi, I'm sorry. Is it okay if I
come out here for a few minutes?

331
00:21:46,975 --> 00:21:48,946
Yeah, sure, just stay
up here, if you would.

332
00:22:00,007 --> 00:22:05,318
Excuse me, I wonder if you
have a- an extra cigarette?

333
00:22:05,354 --> 00:22:08,125
I sure could use a smoke
right about now.

334
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,863
Sure.

335
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:14,875
Thank you.

336
00:22:20,624 --> 00:22:22,326
Thanks.

337
00:22:59,854 --> 00:23:01,556
Hey, what's up?

338
00:23:04,297 --> 00:23:05,667
What?

339
00:23:05,701 --> 00:23:07,970
Hey- Hey-

340
00:23:09,508 --> 00:23:11,012
What's wrong with him?

341
00:23:13,251 --> 00:23:14,620
What hospital?

342
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,433
Andrea.

343
00:23:20,468 --> 00:23:22,571
Jesse.

344
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:24,074
Where's Brock?
They've got him inside.

345
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:25,210
Grandma's with him.

346
00:23:25,245 --> 00:23:27,716
They got me filling out
all this paperwork-

347
00:23:27,752 --> 00:23:29,588
How's he doing?
Tell me what's going on?

348
00:23:29,622 --> 00:23:33,197
The doctors- they don't
know what it is exactly.

349
00:23:33,231 --> 00:23:36,004
It's like- It's like
he's got the flu,

350
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:38,710
but- but he just keeps
getting worse.

351
00:23:38,744 --> 00:23:39,979
Oh...

352
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,862
Jess, I don't understand.

353
00:23:45,897 --> 00:23:47,666
He was fine this morning.

354
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,809
He was fine.

355
00:23:54,918 --> 00:23:56,922
- Andrea Cantillo?
- Right here.

356
00:23:56,956 --> 00:23:58,893
Ms. Cantillo,
we're going to go ahead

357
00:23:58,928 --> 00:24:01,400
and admit your son
to the pediatric ICU.

358
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:03,639
- You can bring that with you.
- Okay.

359
00:24:03,672 --> 00:24:05,108
So you're the boy's father?

360
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:07,649
- No.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

361
00:24:07,683 --> 00:24:10,055
It's just we try to keep it to
two visitors maximum, so- okay?

362
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:11,892
No, go, go.
I'll be out here if you need me.

363
00:24:11,927 --> 00:24:13,163
Go, go ahead.

364
00:24:42,132 --> 00:24:43,801
No.

365
00:24:43,837 --> 00:24:46,208
No, no.

366
00:24:46,241 --> 00:24:48,613
No. No.

367
00:24:48,648 --> 00:24:50,651
No... no...

368
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:53,928
Come on.

369
00:24:54,998 --> 00:24:57,102
No!

370
00:24:57,136 --> 00:24:58,572
No, No.

371
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,504
Andrea!

372
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:12,540
Andr-

373
00:25:12,575 --> 00:25:13,943
Hey, hey, hey, no yelling.

374
00:25:13,977 --> 00:25:15,579
- Andrea- I need-
- We can't have you back here.

375
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:16,984
No, I need to talk to her.
All right? I need to talk to her.

376
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:18,152
You two,
just take this outside.

377
00:25:18,187 --> 00:25:19,622
Would you please-

378
00:25:19,658 --> 00:25:20,892
Brock is sick in here.

379
00:25:20,926 --> 00:25:22,295
Come here-
Here.

380
00:25:22,329 --> 00:25:23,565
Jesse...

381
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:26,170
Jesse, what is it?

382
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:28,508
Jesse, I can't go.

383
00:25:28,544 --> 00:25:29,644
Brock stays in here.

384
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:30,714
- Okay.
- What-

385
00:25:30,748 --> 00:25:32,885
I'm- I'm thinking Brock

386
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:34,189
may have been poisoned.
Okay?

387
00:25:34,223 --> 00:25:35,926
What?

388
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,569
There's this stuff,
this stuff called ricin.

389
00:25:39,602 --> 00:25:40,703
It sounds like "rice. "

390
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:42,809
You need to tell
the doctors about it.

391
00:25:42,844 --> 00:25:44,580
Why would you say that?
How do you know?

392
00:25:44,614 --> 00:25:47,354
It doesn't matter.
Just tell them it's a guess.

393
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:48,691
Okay? Ricin.

394
00:25:48,725 --> 00:25:50,662
They'll know
what you're talking about.

395
00:25:50,697 --> 00:25:52,833
Jesse, if there's something
you're not saying,

396
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:54,438
you've got to tell me-

397
00:25:54,472 --> 00:25:56,609
Look, I gotta go.
I gotta go see some one.

398
00:25:56,644 --> 00:25:57,813
- Jesse.
- Look, I'm sorry.

399
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,817
I'm sorr- I gotta go.
Just tell them.

400
00:25:59,853 --> 00:26:01,454
Okay? Now! Just do it!

401
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,605
Hello? Can you buzz me in,
please?

402
00:26:08,639 --> 00:26:10,075
Buzz me in!

403
00:26:39,313 --> 00:26:41,351
What do you want?

404
00:26:41,385 --> 00:26:42,721
We need to talk.

405
00:26:44,827 --> 00:26:45,861
Who's with you?

406
00:26:45,897 --> 00:26:48,335
No one, just me.
Let me in.

407
00:27:04,406 --> 00:27:06,010
I don't know what you're
thinking coming here.

408
00:27:08,749 --> 00:27:10,854
Oh, Christ.

409
00:27:10,887 --> 00:27:12,791
What does it matter?

410
00:27:12,826 --> 00:27:16,802
Everything, it's all-
all coming to an end.

411
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,541
Do you even know
what's happening,

412
00:27:19,576 --> 00:27:21,779
the full scope
of what's happening?

413
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,386
They took me out
into the desert.

414
00:27:24,421 --> 00:27:26,959
They put a hood over my head

415
00:27:26,993 --> 00:27:28,529
and drove me out
into the desert,

416
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,599
on my knees.

417
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:31,537
They threatened my family,

418
00:27:31,572 --> 00:27:32,974
and not just Hank.

419
00:27:35,213 --> 00:27:38,320
My wife, my children...

420
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:45,537
It's just a matter of time now.

421
00:27:47,777 --> 00:27:52,254
I was- I was able
to protect them for now,

422
00:27:52,288 --> 00:27:53,456
but...

423
00:27:56,632 --> 00:27:58,603
Gus is going to make
his move...

424
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:16,447
and I don't-
I don't know when.

425
00:28:16,481 --> 00:28:19,554
I don't know where or how.

426
00:28:22,195 --> 00:28:24,031
All I know is
it's going to happen.

427
00:28:30,982 --> 00:28:32,852
And I'm powerless to stop him.

428
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:40,305
What are you doing?

429
00:28:42,812 --> 00:28:44,849
Why did you do it?

430
00:28:44,884 --> 00:28:46,020
Why?

431
00:28:46,054 --> 00:28:49,461
Jesse, Gus gave me no choice.

432
00:28:49,496 --> 00:28:51,299
I had to call the DEA

433
00:28:51,334 --> 00:28:52,536
to protect my family.

434
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:53,639
What else could I do?

435
00:28:53,672 --> 00:28:55,543
No. No, you son of a bitch.

436
00:28:55,578 --> 00:28:56,812
You know what you did.

437
00:28:56,847 --> 00:28:58,950
Okay, look, just-

438
00:28:58,985 --> 00:29:00,219
just put the gun down.

439
00:29:00,254 --> 00:29:02,391
Okay? Just put it down,
and we'll talk.

440
00:29:02,426 --> 00:29:03,661
All right?

441
00:29:03,696 --> 00:29:06,835
You tell me- tell me what
it is you think I did.

442
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:09,608
Brock-
why did you poison him?

443
00:29:09,642 --> 00:29:11,245
Who's Brock?

444
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,948
You saw him in my living room
just last night.

445
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,288
You came to my door,
and you looked right at him,

446
00:29:15,323 --> 00:29:17,327
so don't tell me
you don't know him.

447
00:29:17,361 --> 00:29:19,098
The boy.

448
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:22,840
Jesse, I have no idea
who these people are.

449
00:29:22,876 --> 00:29:26,182
Now, please-
Okay, that's Brock,

450
00:29:26,217 --> 00:29:27,786
and- and he was poisoned?

451
00:29:27,821 --> 00:29:33,333
The ricin! He's dying because
someone gave it to him,

452
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:35,104
and only you and I

453
00:29:35,138 --> 00:29:36,908
were the only two people
on earth

454
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,578
who knew about it.

455
00:29:38,613 --> 00:29:40,148
Now wait a minute.

456
00:29:40,184 --> 00:29:41,384
Wait a minute.

457
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:42,654
Maybe he went into
your pockets and accid-

458
00:29:42,689 --> 00:29:43,757
No!

459
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:45,494
I had it.

460
00:29:45,528 --> 00:29:47,799
I had the cigarette
with the ricin in my pack

461
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,136
this morning.

462
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:51,942
The last time I saw Brock
was last night,

463
00:29:51,976 --> 00:29:53,212
and this morning

464
00:29:53,245 --> 00:29:55,150
I switched the cigarette
into a new pack.

465
00:29:55,185 --> 00:29:57,388
There's no way
Brock took it himself.

466
00:29:57,424 --> 00:29:59,828
Jesse, you're not thinking
clearly.

467
00:29:59,863 --> 00:30:01,466
Listen, you said it yourself

468
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,903
that you had it this morning.

469
00:30:02,937 --> 00:30:05,310
Then when could I have
possibly gotten it?

470
00:30:05,344 --> 00:30:07,814
You- You had Saul do it.

471
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,452
- What?
- Yeah.

472
00:30:09,487 --> 00:30:11,624
Yeah, I went to his office.

473
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:13,562
He called me and just had
to see me today.

474
00:30:13,597 --> 00:30:15,834
His big man-mountain bodyguard
patted me down.

475
00:30:15,868 --> 00:30:19,074
That's when he must've stolen
it off of me, right?

476
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,912
That's the plan?
Was that the plan?

477
00:30:23,753 --> 00:30:27,562
Jesse, why?

478
00:30:27,596 --> 00:30:31,203
Why, in God's name,

479
00:30:31,237 --> 00:30:32,939
would I poison a child?

480
00:30:32,974 --> 00:30:34,410
To get back at me.

481
00:30:36,183 --> 00:30:38,086
Because I'm helping Gus,

482
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,756
and this is your way

483
00:30:39,792 --> 00:30:41,227
of ripping my heart out

484
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:43,198
before you're dead and gone.

485
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:45,170
Just admit it.

486
00:30:45,204 --> 00:30:47,508
Admit what you did.

487
00:30:47,543 --> 00:30:48,611
Admit it!

488
00:30:48,644 --> 00:30:49,813
I did not do this!

489
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,517
Shut up!

490
00:30:51,553 --> 00:30:53,923
Stop lying!

491
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:55,327
I'm not- I'm not lying.

492
00:30:55,361 --> 00:30:56,964
I'm not lying.
Just listen to me.

493
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,738
Listen to me.
What would I have to gain?

494
00:30:59,772 --> 00:31:03,381
What possible,
possible could-

495
00:31:03,415 --> 00:31:04,884
Who- Who would-

496
00:31:08,361 --> 00:31:09,764
Oh, my God.

497
00:31:13,808 --> 00:31:15,243
Hey.

498
00:31:18,385 --> 00:31:19,586
Stop laughing.

499
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:22,392
Stop laughing!

500
00:31:27,873 --> 00:31:29,474
I have been waiting.

501
00:31:30,912 --> 00:31:33,852
I have been waiting all day,

502
00:31:33,887 --> 00:31:35,858
waiting for Gus to send

503
00:31:35,892 --> 00:31:37,795
one of his men to kill me...

504
00:31:40,502 --> 00:31:42,272
and it's you.

505
00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:47,785
Who do you know

506
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:50,860
who's okay with using
children, Jesse?

507
00:31:50,894 --> 00:31:54,835
Who do you know who has allowed
children to be murdered?

508
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:57,775
Hm? Gus!

509
00:31:57,809 --> 00:32:02,051
He has- He has been 10 steps
ahead of me at every turn,

510
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,023
and now the one thing

511
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:05,158
that he needed

512
00:32:05,193 --> 00:32:06,930
to finally get rid of me
is your consent,

513
00:32:06,964 --> 00:32:08,100
and, boy, he's got that now.

514
00:32:08,133 --> 00:32:09,302
He's got it.

515
00:32:09,338 --> 00:32:12,142
And not only does he have that,

516
00:32:12,177 --> 00:32:13,914
but he manipulated you

517
00:32:13,949 --> 00:32:15,452
into pulling the trigger
for him.

518
00:32:15,486 --> 00:32:18,392
Only you and I knew
about the ricin!

519
00:32:18,427 --> 00:32:20,698
No! You don't even
believe that

520
00:32:20,734 --> 00:32:23,004
with Gus' cameras everywhere.

521
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,712
Please. Listen to yourself.

522
00:32:25,746 --> 00:32:28,419
No, he has known everything
all along.

523
00:32:28,453 --> 00:32:30,490
Where were you today?
In the lab?

524
00:32:30,525 --> 00:32:32,161
And you don't think
it's possible

525
00:32:32,195 --> 00:32:35,434
that Tyrus lifted the cigarette
out of your locker?

526
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,041
Come on.

527
00:32:38,076 --> 00:32:39,945
Don't you see?

528
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,685
You are the last piece
of the puzzle.

529
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:44,923
You are everything
that he's wanted.

530
00:32:44,956 --> 00:32:47,028
You're his cook now.

531
00:32:47,062 --> 00:32:48,765
You're the cook,
and you have proven

532
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,571
that you can run a lab
without me,

533
00:32:51,607 --> 00:32:54,579
and now that cook
has reason to kill me.

534
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,520
Think about it!

535
00:32:57,555 --> 00:32:59,658
It's brilliant.

536
00:33:00,963 --> 00:33:02,165
So go ahead.

537
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,306
Go ahead.

538
00:33:05,342 --> 00:33:09,952
If you think that I am capable
of doing this, then go ahead.

539
00:33:09,985 --> 00:33:13,159
Put a bullet in my head

540
00:33:13,194 --> 00:33:14,998
and kill me right now.

541
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:19,341
Do it!

542
00:33:20,478 --> 00:33:22,048
Do it.

543
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,317
I'll do it.

544
00:33:23,352 --> 00:33:24,687
Do it.

545
00:33:26,694 --> 00:33:28,029
Do it.

546
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:58,970
Where are you going?

547
00:33:59,005 --> 00:34:00,173
I'm going to find
the son of a bitch,

548
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:01,275
and I'm going to kill him.

549
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:04,015
No, don't.

550
00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:05,853
He'll see you coming.

551
00:34:10,232 --> 00:34:13,238
You'll die before you get
anywhere near him.

552
00:34:13,272 --> 00:34:14,507
I don't care.

553
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:19,185
Jesse. Jesse,
just get in your car.

554
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:20,823
Just go.

555
00:34:20,857 --> 00:34:23,227
Just drive.

556
00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:28,072
No, I'm going to do this
one way or another, Mr. White.

557
00:34:31,348 --> 00:34:32,817
Then let me help.

558
00:35:01,991 --> 00:35:04,864
Oh, Jesus, Mr. Pinkman,

559
00:35:04,899 --> 00:35:06,703
I'm not going to keep
telling you.

560
00:35:06,736 --> 00:35:08,439
Unless the family wants you
in there,

561
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:09,776
you're not allowed.

562
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,018
You can't keep coming
in here like this.

563
00:35:14,053 --> 00:35:17,560
You hear me?
You understand?

564
00:35:17,594 --> 00:35:20,165
Mr. Pinkman,
I'm going to call Security.

565
00:35:23,308 --> 00:35:24,676
All right, here we go.

566
00:35:28,687 --> 00:35:31,093
Come on now.

567
00:35:31,126 --> 00:35:32,763
Mr. Pinkman,
final warning.

568
00:36:03,842 --> 00:36:05,545
Hey.

569
00:36:07,718 --> 00:36:11,226
You need to be at work now.

570
00:36:11,259 --> 00:36:13,330
I already told you.
I'm not going.

571
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:19,478
You've got a batch
that will be ruined

572
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:22,452
and an employer
who will be very upset

573
00:36:22,486 --> 00:36:23,721
if that happens.

574
00:36:23,755 --> 00:36:26,160
And I could give a shit.

575
00:36:27,397 --> 00:36:29,100
I'm not leaving here.

576
00:36:29,135 --> 00:36:32,007
If my employer
has a problem with that,

577
00:36:32,043 --> 00:36:34,012
he can tell me himself,

578
00:36:34,046 --> 00:36:36,017
not his errand boy.

579
00:36:40,796 --> 00:36:42,266
Get-

580
00:36:44,138 --> 00:36:45,807
Hey, I don't know this guy!

581
00:36:45,842 --> 00:36:47,111
Call Security!

582
00:36:47,144 --> 00:36:49,515
I'm being attacked!

583
00:36:55,098 --> 00:36:57,802
Yeah, that's right.

584
00:37:13,374 --> 00:37:15,111
We've got a situation.

585
00:39:12,527 --> 00:39:15,065
He'd like to speak with you.

586
00:39:15,101 --> 00:39:17,939
I told you, I'm not leaving.

587
00:39:17,975 --> 00:39:20,046
He's downstairs.

588
00:39:35,283 --> 00:39:37,587
Tyrus told me
what's happening-

589
00:39:38,924 --> 00:39:40,359
the sick child.

590
00:39:41,997 --> 00:39:44,302
I understand
your preoccupation,

591
00:39:44,336 --> 00:39:46,775
but, Jesse,
I am running a business.

592
00:39:49,048 --> 00:39:51,653
I need you back at the lab
to complete the cook.

593
00:39:51,687 --> 00:39:54,459
You can return
when you're done.

594
00:39:56,933 --> 00:39:59,404
I can't.

595
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:01,275
It is, as you must know,

596
00:40:01,309 --> 00:40:03,146
in both of our best interests.

597
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:07,657
That little boy upstairs

598
00:40:07,691 --> 00:40:09,327
is dying.

599
00:40:11,266 --> 00:40:15,041
I can't be away.
I don't even want to be here now.

600
00:40:15,074 --> 00:40:18,115
I can't be away if
something happens, if he-

601
00:40:18,148 --> 00:40:20,386
I am very sorry.

602
00:40:22,092 --> 00:40:23,862
Is there anything I can do?

603
00:40:23,896 --> 00:40:26,469
I am on the board
of this hospital.

604
00:40:26,503 --> 00:40:29,108
I can recommend doctors,

605
00:40:29,143 --> 00:40:32,117
make sure he gets
whatever he needs,

606
00:40:32,151 --> 00:40:33,687
the best treatment.

607
00:40:35,962 --> 00:40:37,464
He's not sick.

608
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:41,507
He was poisoned.

609
00:40:44,882 --> 00:40:46,350
How did that happen?

610
00:40:48,858 --> 00:40:50,194
The doctors-

611
00:40:51,933 --> 00:40:53,269
they don't know.

612
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:07,805
This current batch...

613
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:12,050
is surely ruined now.

614
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:13,452
Correct?

615
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:29,422
Stay with the boy.

616
00:41:31,529 --> 00:41:35,204
Tyrus will dump what's there
and clean the tanks.

617
00:41:35,238 --> 00:41:38,278
You will start a new batch

618
00:41:38,312 --> 00:41:39,981
when you are ready to return...

619
00:41:44,393 --> 00:41:45,596
next week.

620
00:42:17,172 --> 00:42:18,874
There you are.

621
00:42:20,882 --> 00:42:22,318
There you are.

622
00:42:42,032 --> 00:42:43,468
Keep going.

623
00:43:04,752 --> 00:43:05,753
Why'd you stop?

624
00:43:06,758 --> 00:43:07,959
Why did you stop?

625
00:43:16,447 --> 00:43:18,117
Why did you stop?

626
00:43:23,164 --> 00:43:25,434
Come on.
Come on.

627
00:44:07,868 --> 00:44:09,236
Come on, come on.

628
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:13,080
Please. Oh, God, please.

629
00:44:13,114 --> 00:44:14,717
Please.

630
00:44:38,205 --> 00:44:39,607
No, no, no. No, don't go.

631
00:44:39,641 --> 00:44:41,078
Don't go, don't go, don't go.

632
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:43,417
No. No.

633
00:44:45,656 --> 00:44:47,393
Oh, sh...

634
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,703
No.

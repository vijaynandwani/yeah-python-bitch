He can't keep getting
away with it!

5
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:21,768
He won't.
Do you really want to burn him down?

6
00:00:21,864 --> 00:00:24,829
Let's do it together.
I put a wire on you, let him explain.

I'm a dead man.

Todd, I think I might have
another job for your uncle.

11
00:00:40,996 --> 00:00:42,713
So, how big's the batch?

12
00:00:42,748 --> 00:00:44,698
Should be about 50 pounds,
give or take.

Uncle Jack, that mask...

00:00:46,668 --> 00:00:48,919
I think you should...

Mr. White says the fumes
aren't good to breathe.

16
00:00:52,257 --> 00:00:54,058
Let me worry about
what I breathe, kid.

17
00:00:54,092 --> 00:00:56,543

- Thanks, Uncle Jack.

Where is the blue?

21

Where's the what?

22
00:01:42,774 --> 00:01:44,258
The blue color.

23
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:46,894
Does it come later,
when this hardens?

24
00:01:46,928 --> 00:01:48,929
Where is it?

25
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:53,701
I am correct in assuming
this should be blue?

26
00:01:53,735 --> 00:01:56,704
See, I'm thinking the headline
here should be "76%."

27
00:01:56,738 --> 00:01:58,956
Yeah. Whole lot more
than it was.

That dude who looked like Wolverine--
he couldn't crack 70.

Fine. Yes,

30
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:06,247
percentage-wise,
it's marginally improved.

31
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:07,915
And congratulations, Todd.

32
00:02:07,949 --> 00:02:10,617
But blue is our brand.
All over Europe,

33
00:02:10,635 --> 00:02:13,170
it's what our buyers
pay top dollar for.

If we're down a bit in purity
from the Heisenberg days,

00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:17,842
maybe they'll let us
slide on that,

36
00:02:17,893 --> 00:02:20,261
but not if it's not blue.

37
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:24,431
I don't know.
To my eye,

38
00:02:24,465 --> 00:02:26,100
it's kind of blue.

39
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:27,601
Yeah, a little.

40
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:29,403
It's blue-ish.

What do you think?

00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:42,166
Yeah, kinda...

43
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,201
If it catches the light
just right,

44
00:02:44,252 --> 00:02:47,171
I could see how you'd think

45
00:02:47,205 --> 00:02:49,156
there's a touch of blue,

46
00:02:49,174 --> 00:02:51,425
blue-green in there.

you want.

- Yeah. Like they do farm-raised salmon.
- Yeah.

51

Jesus, you ever see how pink
they make that crap?

I made it just like you asked.

Mm-hmm.

Look, about the product...

63
00:03:51,186 --> 00:03:53,771
I'm really sorry
about the color.

64
00:03:53,805 --> 00:03:56,756

it just got a few degrees too hot

in the mixing kettle, I think.

66
00:03:58,726 --> 00:04:01,779
I might've just cooked the
color right out of it.

67

You burned it, like a cake.

68

Yeah, sort of, I guess.

69
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:11,205
But the point is
I think I can fix it,

70
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,708
and I think I can bring
the purity up too.

my brother-in-law can be.

162
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,504
Nice poker face.

163
00:10:30,538 --> 00:10:32,423
Look, uh, relax.

164
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:35,075
There's not much new you can
tell me about Walter White.

165
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,077
Multiple murders,

166
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,413
uh, ties to a white power
prison gang,

167
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,099
ran the largest meth racket
in the entire Southwest.

168
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:44,802
I'm not asking,
you're not answering.

169
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,970
Whoop-de-doo.
Let's cut to the chase.

170
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,022
We have a wire on Walt's phone.

171
00:10:49,057 --> 00:10:51,258
We intercepted a call
between him

172
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,944
and a certain Saul Goodman,
esquire.

173
00:10:53,978 --> 00:10:56,613
You know, your employer.

174
00:10:56,648 --> 00:10:59,700
Anyway, in the call, uh, Walt said
that he was going to, quote,

175
00:10:59,734 --> 00:11:02,369
"Take care of one Jesse Pinkman,"
unquote,

176
00:11:02,404 --> 00:11:04,288
and that you were next
on the hit list.

177
00:11:04,322 --> 00:11:05,622
That's why you're here.

178
00:11:05,657 --> 00:11:07,908
Bullshit.
That don't make no sense.

179
00:11:07,942 --> 00:11:10,444
We got the recording.
I can-- I can let you hear it.

180
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:13,080
Your associate, Goodman's fixer--
What's his name?

181
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:15,382
Some carrottop
named Patrick Kuby.

182
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:18,051
Boston PD ran him out of
Beantown a few years back.

183
00:11:18,086 --> 00:11:19,619
Came out here for the sunshine.

184
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,890
Yeah. Walt said he was gonna do this
Kuby guy the same way he does you.

185
00:11:22,924 --> 00:11:25,092
In fact,
Kuby's already missing.

186
00:11:25,126 --> 00:11:27,094
Sorry to say,
things are looking grim

187
00:11:27,128 --> 00:11:28,962
for your--
your redheaded buddy.

188
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,466
Believe us, don't believe us.
Suit yourself.

189
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,985
Whatever you do,
I would not call Goodman.

190
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:36,970
He sold you
down the river big-time.

191
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,907
- The hell you talkin' about?
- Oh, don't take it personally.

192
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:42,809
Goodman's next on the chopping block
if he doesn't do what White says.

193
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,145
And to be fair,
your, uh, circus clown of a boss

194
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,164
did try to spare you
for all of, what,

195
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:49,166
about 15 seconds
[Chuckles]

196
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,151
Before he decided
to help Walt track you down.

197
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:54,154
You see, Goodman's got
a trace on your phone,

198
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,822
and as soon as you call him,

199
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,824
uh, Walt's gonna find out
where you're hiding out.

200
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,344
And then it's just a matter of time
before you end up like this.

201
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:04,798
[Scoffs]
Oh, man. Oh, man.

202
00:12:04,832 --> 00:12:07,384
I swear to God, I didn't know
he was gonna kill the man.

203
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,470
I didn't know he was gonna kill him.
I didn't know.

204
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:11,004
- Relax.
- I didn't know he was gonna kill him.

205
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,523
If we thought you did,
you'd be in lockup

206
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:14,057
for conspiracy to commit murder

207
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,642
instead of here,
under our protection.

208
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:17,644
So just tell us everything
you know about White

209
00:12:17,678 --> 00:12:19,146
so we can get him
before he gets you.

210
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,148
Why would he wanna kill me?

211
00:12:21,182 --> 00:12:23,484
- I ain't do nothin' to him.
- Who knows with this guy?

212
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:25,619
From what he said to Goodman,
it may have something to do

213
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:27,287
with him trying
to tie up loose ends

214
00:12:27,322 --> 00:12:29,990
regarding his poisoning
some kid named Brock.

215
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:34,211
Or maybe it's 'cause you know
where his money is.

216
00:12:34,245 --> 00:12:36,163
I don't know
where his money is.

217
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:37,664
That ain't what we heard.

218
00:12:37,698 --> 00:12:40,000
Well, you ain't listening
to the people in the know.

219
00:12:40,034 --> 00:12:42,135
Me and Kuby
rented a van for the dude,

220
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,005
loaded his cash up
in a self-storage unit,

221
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:47,707
handed over the keys
to him at Goodman's.

222
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,060
And who knows
where he took it from there?

223
00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:52,879
A van, huh?
How much money we talking?

224
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,065
Seven barrels' worth.

225
00:12:55,099 --> 00:12:56,650
Seven barrels?

226
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:00,404
When you--
you say "barrels,"

227
00:13:00,438 --> 00:13:02,406
you mean <i>barrels</i> barrels?

228
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,274
Barrels, man.
You know,

229
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,661
plastic, black,
55-gallon type.

230
00:13:07,695 --> 00:13:09,162
I got 'em at Home Depot.

231
00:13:09,197 --> 00:13:11,832
Filled up every last damn
one of 'em too.

232
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,085
And, uh, where did you
rent the van?

233
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:16,537
Lariat.

234
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:19,072
The one on Candelaria
and Monroe.

235
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:23,910
- Lariat on Candelaria?
- Yeah!

236
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,912
Kuby rented the van.

237
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,631
Mr. White dropped it off.

238
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,100
He had us wash it good
before Kuby took it back.

239
00:13:30,134 --> 00:13:31,685
Wash the rental?
Why?

240
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:34,521
It was filthy, man,
like he had went off road with it.

241
00:13:34,556 --> 00:13:37,774
After we had hosed it down,
he grabbed a shovel out the back,

242
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:40,527
handed over the key,
and that was it.

243
00:13:40,562 --> 00:13:41,945
That's all I know.

244
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:47,651
All right, uh, Mr. Babineaux.

245
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:50,621
Agent Gomez and I

246
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:53,290
are going to, uh,
do everything we can

247
00:13:53,324 --> 00:13:55,242
to find the son of a bitch.

248
00:13:55,276 --> 00:13:57,044
Meantime, like I said,
you're free to go.

249
00:13:57,078 --> 00:13:59,630
But if I were you,
I wouldn't take one step out that door.

250
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:02,299
[Gomez] Right. And
remember, no phone calls.

251
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,084
Oh, almost forgot.

252
00:14:04,118 --> 00:14:06,420
Uh, I took the liberty
of removing the battery

253
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:08,722
so Walt can't, uh,
track you by GPS.

254
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:11,642
So don't put that back in.

255
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:13,927
Agent Van Oster
will stay here with you.

256
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:16,313
You're in good hands.
He's our best man with a gun.

257
00:14:16,347 --> 00:14:18,632
Uh, however, don't discuss
the case with him,

258
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,301
because the less
you distract him,

259
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,987
the better he can protect you.

260
00:14:24,022 --> 00:14:26,156
How long you gonna be?

261
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,443
As long as it takes
to keep you safe.

262
00:14:41,656 --> 00:14:44,091
[Jack]
So just one guy this time.

263
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,376
Not even in lockup.

264
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,299
Some former partner, Todd says?

265
00:14:54,552 --> 00:14:55,852
Yeah.

266
00:14:55,887 --> 00:14:58,138
So what are we talking,
rat patrol?

267
00:15:00,224 --> 00:15:01,942
"Rat p--"

268
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,561
No, no.

269
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,898
"Rat patrol"?
No. No, he's not a rat.

270
00:15:09,183 --> 00:15:11,184
He's just...

271
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,238
He-- he just...

272
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,457
won't listen to reason.

273
00:15:17,492 --> 00:15:19,710
- Okay.
- He's just angry.

274
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:21,495
He's not a rat.

275
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:23,530
All right.

276
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:27,000
Angry, non-rat.
Got it.

277
00:15:27,034 --> 00:15:28,752
How angry we talkin',
by the way?

278
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,704
Like, Hulk angry?

279
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:35,676
Like, "Rambo James Bond
badass" individual?

280
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,732
Not something
you'd do yourself, huh?

281
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:45,852
Jesse is like family to me.

282
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,223
Look, I want what you do
to be quick

283
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,891
and painless.

284
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,994
No suffering, no fear.

285
00:15:54,028 --> 00:15:57,164
Bullet to the back of the head.
Something he doesn't see coming.

286
00:15:57,198 --> 00:15:59,082
I respect that.

287
00:15:59,117 --> 00:16:00,784
There's too many savages
out there.

288
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,736
Let's just talk
about the money.

289
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,921
[Chuckling] No,
we don't want your money.

290
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,175
We want you to cook for us.

291
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:10,127
[Scoffs]

292
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:20,971
You know I'm
out of the business.

293
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,724
Just a couple times
to tutor my nephew here, that's all.

294
00:16:23,758 --> 00:16:26,926
Get him on track
to bringing the purity up.

295
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,596
Get the color right too.

296
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,449
Apparently that blue touch
you put on it--

297
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:34,901
it's all the craze
with those Slavic types.

298
00:16:34,935 --> 00:16:36,403
So I'm told.

299
00:16:36,488 --> 00:16:39,189
No. Absolutely not.

300
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:43,110
Look, what was the price
per head last time? I'll triple it.

301
00:16:43,144 --> 00:16:46,614
That's a drop in the bucket compared to
what we aim to earn from the blue stuff.

302
00:16:46,648 --> 00:16:49,316
Don't skimp on family.
That's what I always say.

303
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:51,035
You want us to do this job?

304
00:16:51,086 --> 00:16:54,038
Do it right?
That's the price.

305
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:08,135
One cook...

306
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:10,888
after the job is done.

307
00:17:29,857 --> 00:17:32,025
Time is of the essence.
Do you understand?

308
00:17:32,043 --> 00:17:34,378
We'll do him tonight
if you want.

309
00:17:34,412 --> 00:17:36,413
Just tell me where he is.

310
00:17:36,464 --> 00:17:39,383
I don't know where he is,

311
00:17:40,835 --> 00:17:43,370
but I know how
to flush him out.

312
00:17:46,895 --> 00:17:49,063
You want String Cheese
or Yogurt Squeezers

313
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:50,565
with your PBJ?

314
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:52,483
Both.

315
00:17:52,534 --> 00:17:55,486
- I didn't hear you.
- Both, please.

316

I'm Walter White,

Yeah. Oh, hi. Hi.

00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:16,341
I'm sorry to just barge in
on you like this,

324
00:18:16,392 --> 00:18:20,144
but, uh, I was hoping that I could
have a moment to talk with you.

Um, okay. Sure. But I'm sort of
rushing around right now.

Yes. Yes, I have.

I don't wanna alarm you,

341
00:18:57,499 --> 00:19:00,134
but I've-- I've been trying
to reach him for days.

342
00:19:00,168 --> 00:19:01,636
I've stopped at his house.

343
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,238
I've left all kinds of messages
on his voicemail,

344
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:05,740
and he won't return my calls.

345
00:19:05,774 --> 00:19:07,558
I can't find him anywhere.

346

Have you heard from him?

347
00:19:09,528 --> 00:19:12,012
No, not since the last time
he called to check on Brock.

348
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:13,531
That was--
I don't know--

00:19:13,565 --> 00:19:15,616
two weeks ago, maybe.

353
00:19:23,492 --> 00:19:25,910
I have a bad feeling
about this.

354
00:19:27,746 --> 00:19:29,747
Have you tried
calling the police?

355
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:34,335
Or, um--
a better idea.

356
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:37,705
Jesse's lawyer's name is Saul Goodman.
I have his card somewhere.

357
00:19:37,723 --> 00:19:39,507
I mean, he may have ways
of finding Jesse

358
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,225
without, you know,
getting him in trouble.

359
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,595
"Better Call Saul."
Yeah. I-- I did that.

360
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:47,098
He was able to verify
that Jesse's not locked up.

361
00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:51,319
But otherwise,
very little help.

362
00:19:53,072 --> 00:19:54,856
See, the thing is

363
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,109
is that Jesse and I
had this argument recently.

364
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,579
And I-- I won't bore you
with the details, but, uh,

365
00:20:01,613 --> 00:20:04,165
he's-- he's--

366
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:08,202
he's pretty upset
with me, and, uh--

367
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:11,205
and I'm hoping that's the reason
he hasn't called me back

368
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:13,007
instead of...

369
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,760

370

Well...

371
00:20:20,716 --> 00:20:22,750
Well, I'll try him right now.

he's mad at you,

maybe I'll have better luck.

Good to meet you.

Okay.

Make sure you get in there

booger powder in there,

He's not answering his phone.

So what about Jesse?

495
00:26:00,478 --> 00:26:02,462
He hasn't shown up yet.

496
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,098
He will, Saul.
He's probably high as a kite somewhere

497
00:26:05,132 --> 00:26:07,017
and hasn't gotten
our message yet.

498
00:26:07,068 --> 00:26:09,686
Or he got it loud and clear
and figured out it's a setup.

499
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:12,522
The kid is not as dumb
as you think.

500

Are you wearing
a bulletproof vest?

501

Did you miss the part about
my bodyguard has gone missing?

502
00:26:24,335 --> 00:26:27,254
Look, I had him
watching the dog house,

503
00:26:27,288 --> 00:26:29,256
figuring the kid might show up
for a fix.

510
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:50,477

You mark "ten"

the actual stock column here.

Took it in the backyard

you have the right

in a court of law.

You have the right

and have an attorney present
during any questioning.

If you cannot afford
an attorney,

689
00:40:08,937 --> 00:40:11,389
one will be provided for you
at the government's expense.

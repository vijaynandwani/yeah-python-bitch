1
00:00:04,262 --> 00:00:05,535
Operation...

2
00:00:06,094 --> 00:00:07,387
Icebreaker.

3
00:00:10,058 --> 00:00:12,799
How we liking that?
We never used that before, did we?

4
00:00:12,856 --> 00:00:14,883
- Isn't it the name of a breath mint?
- What?

5
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:16,695
"Icebreakers", right? Breath mint?

6
00:00:16,798 --> 00:00:18,293
Nobody's gonna be
thinking that.

7
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:21,115
They'll think about a big ass ship
in the North Pole, breaking ice.

8
00:00:21,242 --> 00:00:24,468
Says you. I'm gonna be thinking
"Operation Breath Mint."

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,265
I'm thinking "Operation Breath Mint"
every time we're on a stakeout together.

10
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:31,203
Your breath could knock
a buzzard off a shit wagon.

11
00:00:31,324 --> 00:00:32,580
All right.

12
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:35,589
"Operation TBD."

13
00:00:35,978 --> 00:00:37,613
Thanks for nothing, Gomie.

14
00:00:37,676 --> 00:00:39,469
Anyway.
Say hello to...

15
00:00:39,547 --> 00:00:43,053
Domingo Gallardo Molina,
AKA "Krazy 8."

16
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:47,453
Smarter than your average cheese-eater.
I turned him out at the street-level,

17
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,427
but this dude's like
the Jeffersons: movin' on up.

18
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:53,751
Every small-time dealers he'd throw at
us, he'd end up snaking their customers.

19
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:56,349
It turns out he's missing,
presumed dead.

20
00:00:56,435 --> 00:00:58,692
Found his car
out in the boonies.

21
00:00:58,811 --> 00:01:02,782
Last guy he ratted out
was none other than his cousin,

22
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,093
Emilio Koyama.

23
00:01:05,288 --> 00:01:07,496
You thinking the cousin
found out and took revenge?

24
00:01:07,557 --> 00:01:10,102
Could be.
Turns out he's missing, too.

25
00:01:10,327 --> 00:01:13,444
Normally, I'd say someone
did the world a favor.

26
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:15,865
But our snitch's car?

27
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:19,530
Turns out we find two grams of meth
in it, we take it to the lab.

28
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:23,030
They come back, they tell us it is
the purest they have ever seen.

29
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:24,609
99.1%.

30
00:01:24,779 --> 00:01:27,988
Our chemist was blown away. He said
he couldn't do the same thing better.

31
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:31,008
Worse yet, it didn't come out of
some superlab in Mexico.

32
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:34,067
We're thinking this was cooked
right here, in the Land of Enchantment.

33
00:01:34,273 --> 00:01:37,818
Car was abandoned at
what appears to be a cook site.

34
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:40,776
This is the only other
thing left behind.

35
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:44,186
We're sending it off to Quantico,
see if they can pull something off it.

36
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,472
Meantime, our guys swabbed the filter
element and found the same 99.1 meth.

37
00:01:50,808 --> 00:01:52,280
So be on notice.

38
00:01:53,185 --> 00:01:55,201
We got new players in town.

39
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:59,582
We don't know who they are,
where they come from...

40
00:02:00,056 --> 00:02:02,852
but they possess an
extremely high skill-set.

41
00:02:03,058 --> 00:02:04,510
Me personally?

42
00:02:05,698 --> 00:02:09,167
I'm thinking Albuquerque just
might have a new kingpin.

43
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,299
"Cancer Man"

44
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,931
Jesus. Walt, you're burning
the shit out of them.

45
00:02:47,362 --> 00:02:48,557
Damn it.

46
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:51,475
Hey, Sky, you got
any more chicken?

47
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:54,313
Emeril here is gonna
need a fresh pack.

48
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:57,121
All right,
looking good.

49
00:02:57,213 --> 00:02:59,961
Is this low-fat mayonnaise
in the cole slaw?

50
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:03,073
I don't know.
It's store-bought.

51
00:03:04,457 --> 00:03:06,401
Hank, you need
another beer?

52
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,321
Does the Pope shit in his hat?

53
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,216
I don't think
that he does, Hank.

54
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:13,413
And I think everybody would like it
if you'd stop saying that.

55
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:16,368
- Marie, some more wine, maybe?
- I'm all right, thanks.

56
00:03:16,434 --> 00:03:17,915
Hey, I want a beer.

57
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,098
Yeah. I want Shania Twain
to give me a tuggie.

58
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,417
Guess what?
That ain't happening, either.

59
00:03:23,497 --> 00:03:25,740
- How about some more soda?
- Yeah, sure.

60
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:27,742
Honey, do you need anything?

61
00:03:27,856 --> 00:03:30,924
- No, Walt. Thank you.
- Okay. I'll be right back.

62
00:03:52,195 --> 00:03:53,948
What, are you kidding me?

63
00:03:54,074 --> 00:03:56,409
You look like
a damn movie star, man.

64
00:03:56,535 --> 00:03:59,203
Girls gotta be lining up
left and right.

65
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:02,165
- Tell him how good-looking he is.
- He's adorable.

66
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:04,807
He don't wanna be friggin' adorable.
He wants to be hot.

67
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:07,723
You see what I'm talking about?
That's a female perspective.

68
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,286
She supposed to say that.

69
00:04:09,413 --> 00:04:12,117
Look, a guy doesn't have
to look like, uh...

70
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,259
Charlton Heston...
I'm talking "Moses" days...

71
00:04:15,577 --> 00:04:17,353
to get a girl,
all right?

72
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:19,150
You just gotta have...

73
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,224
confidence.

74
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:24,510
Confidence and...
and persistence.

75
00:04:25,303 --> 00:04:26,887
That's what I'm talking about.

76
00:04:27,026 --> 00:04:29,707
I chased your Aunt Marie here
all over creation.

77
00:04:29,907 --> 00:04:32,862
I kept bugging her for a date.
She kept saying no.

78
00:04:32,925 --> 00:04:34,637
What, did I ask you
like 50 times?

79
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,774
It was before
they tightened the stalking laws.

80
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:41,327
Anyway, how about your dad here?

81
00:04:41,704 --> 00:04:43,571
Right there's a good story, Walt.

82
00:04:43,619 --> 00:04:45,119
Tell him how you met Skyler.

83
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:48,186
Mom was a waitress
in Los Alamos.

84
00:04:48,534 --> 00:04:52,419
And Dad said
that thing to you...

85
00:04:52,488 --> 00:04:55,205
Actually, your mother
wasn't a waitress.

86
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:57,508
It was a summer job,

87
00:04:57,527 --> 00:05:00,154
and she was the hostess,

88
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:02,669
and she also worked
the cash register.

89
00:05:02,926 --> 00:05:04,953
And I used to go
in there a lot

90
00:05:04,957 --> 00:05:08,836
because it was close enough to the lab
where I could ride my bicycle.

91
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,521
And once I noticed her...

92
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:15,855
it got to be so that
I would only go in

93
00:05:15,863 --> 00:05:17,857
when I knew she was working.

94
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:21,340
When it was slow,
she would lean against the counter,

95
00:05:21,727 --> 00:05:23,813
doing her crossword puzzles,

96
00:05:24,027 --> 00:05:26,152
but kind of hiding it, right,

97
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:28,585
pretending that
she was still working.

98
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:30,791
And once I caught on to that,

99
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:34,669
I would do crossword puzzles
while I ate my grilled cheese sandwich.

100
00:05:34,742 --> 00:05:37,110
It got so that
everyday at lunch,

101
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:41,061
we would both be doing
the New York Times crossword puzzle

102
00:05:41,184 --> 00:05:43,149
ten feet from each other.

103
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,279
Eventually,

104
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:51,322
I caught her
looking over at me.

105
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,931
So, I began saying,
"Excuse me.

106
00:05:57,115 --> 00:06:00,954
"Fourteen across, seven-letter word
for whatchamacallit.

107
00:06:01,034 --> 00:06:03,647
"May I ask what
you wrote down?"

108
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:08,410
That got us talking.

109
00:06:09,023 --> 00:06:12,491
Boy, I tell you, I was...
I was terrible at those puzzles.

110
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,904
I don't think that I finished
even one of them.

111
00:06:17,372 --> 00:06:19,950
But your mother
would do them in ink.

112
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,156
Very smooth.

113
00:06:23,443 --> 00:06:26,027
I'll bet you didn't think
your old man had it in him?

114
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:28,373
But that's what I'm talking about.
That's persistence.

115
00:06:28,484 --> 00:06:31,513
You see? Once you set
your cap for something,

116
00:06:31,634 --> 00:06:34,446
or somebody,
you gotta just, you know...

117
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:38,462
Skyler?

118
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:40,977
Mom, are you all right?

119
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,058
Shh, honey. It's okay.

120
00:06:45,857 --> 00:06:47,318
What's the matter?

121
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,190
What is it?

122
00:06:53,774 --> 00:06:55,016
Ask him.

123
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:07,409
What's she talking about?

124
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,351
Walt.

125
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,486
I have cancer.

126
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:29,042
Lung cancer.

127
00:07:39,115 --> 00:07:40,357
It's bad.

128
00:08:02,395 --> 00:08:04,551
Ask him how long he's known.

129
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:08,108
I guess a month,
maybe, or...

130
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:09,966
For God sakes, Walt.

131
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:13,042
We're just sitting out there having
a cookout like nothing's going on?

132
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,779
He made me promise
not to tell anybody.

133
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:18,690
Christ, these last 48 hours.

134
00:08:19,945 --> 00:08:21,625
And it's the weekend,

135
00:08:21,887 --> 00:08:24,436
so I couldn't even get
his doctor on the phone.

136
00:08:24,581 --> 00:08:28,235
Buddy, why... I mean,
why wouldn't you want to tell anybody?

137
00:08:29,112 --> 00:08:30,545
Don't you see?

138
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:33,247
Everybody just wants
to help you.

139
00:08:33,703 --> 00:08:35,229
We're family.

140
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,945
We get through
these things together.

141
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:39,990
I mean, I don't get...
You know...

142
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,705
Lung cancer?

143
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,139
How could that happen?
You don't smoke.

144
00:08:44,146 --> 00:08:46,449
I'm thinking that
this goes back

145
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,948
20 years maybe
to the applications lab.

146
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:51,358
All those chemicals
they had you working around?

147
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:53,582
We always took
the proper precautions.

148
00:08:53,683 --> 00:08:57,444
One time you complained they didn't
give you the right kind of...

149
00:08:57,499 --> 00:09:00,769
I don't know, some kind
of ventilation hood or something.

150
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,628
- And then the headaches.
- Honey, it wasn't that.

151
00:09:03,698 --> 00:09:06,487
How do they think they
can get away with this?

152
00:09:06,607 --> 00:09:08,527
We should hire a lawyer.

153
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:11,447
First, let's deal with this.

154
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:15,895
Okay? So what's
the next step for Walt?

155
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,334
Certainly a second
opinion, right?

156
00:09:19,751 --> 00:09:20,720
Right.

157
00:09:21,196 --> 00:09:22,440
Right. Absolutely.

158
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:24,657
Okay. So first thing
tomorrow,

159
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:27,095
I talk to my radiologists,

160
00:09:27,632 --> 00:09:30,052
we find you the best...

161
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:33,242
the oncology dream team.

162
00:09:50,835 --> 00:09:52,962
I wanna go check
on Walt Jr.

163
00:09:54,258 --> 00:09:55,779
I'm gonna see...

164
00:09:56,503 --> 00:09:59,653
if I can talk him into,
I don't know, joining us.

165
00:10:00,235 --> 00:10:03,626
I really didn't mean for him
to find out that way.

166
00:10:13,718 --> 00:10:15,336
Whatever happens...

167
00:10:17,144 --> 00:10:19,628
I hope this goes
without saying, but...

168
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:21,407
whatever happens...

169
00:10:22,691 --> 00:10:24,941
I want you to know that...

170
00:10:26,237 --> 00:10:28,910
I'll always take care
of your family.

171
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:59,057
Yo, check out
these fake Pop Tarts.

172
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,724
These are mad tight.

173
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:03,453
- No, thanks, man. Pass.
- Your loss.

174
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,334
These are from Canada
or something. Imported.

175
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:08,678
Yo, what happened
to your hallway, man?

176
00:11:08,684 --> 00:11:11,540
- Did the ceiling fall down or...
- Oh, yeah...

177
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:15,439
I think the house
is just settling.

178
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,336
It's been caving in
left and right.

179
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:20,098
Hit me in the eye.

180
00:11:20,486 --> 00:11:21,668
It's bananas.

181
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:25,446
Yo, my pops could fix you up.
He's like a contractor or something.

182
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,524
Right on.
I should grab that number.

183
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:31,604
Say, Jesse.
You still cook a little crystal?

184
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,777
Could be, yeah.

185
00:11:36,881 --> 00:11:38,971
You know,
from time to time.

186
00:11:39,202 --> 00:11:41,429
I heard you lost
your partner.

187
00:11:42,222 --> 00:11:43,270
Emilio.

188
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:47,910
- Didn't he get locked up?
- No, man. He's out.

189
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:51,250
His cousin bailed him out.
He skipped town or something.

190
00:11:51,321 --> 00:11:53,431
I don't know about
any of that.

191
00:11:53,615 --> 00:11:56,060
I've been kinda doing
my own thing these days.

192
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,814
But you maybe got
some crystal, man?

193
00:11:59,146 --> 00:12:02,931
'Cause I could seriously go for a bowl.
You know? Take the edge off.

194
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,961
Hell, yeah.
Sunday night bowl, yo.

195
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,861
Maybe it just
so happens that...

196
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,378
I just recently cooked
the best batch ever.

197
00:12:21,021 --> 00:12:23,419
Oh, yeah. Came up with
this whole new recipe.

198
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:25,453
It's more like a formula.

199
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:29,258
It's like way,
way more chemically...

200
00:12:30,477 --> 00:12:32,610
You know, it's just the bomb.

201
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,931
But, you know, I don't know,

202
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:39,304
I've been thinking lately
I'll just lay off of it for a while.

203
00:12:39,364 --> 00:12:42,552
'Cause lately it's been
making me paranoid, so...

204
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,618
You know, for, like...
like healthwise, just lay off.

205
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,896
Yo, if you're not
into sharing, man,

206
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:55,033
just tell us to piss off.
It's cool.

207
00:12:55,077 --> 00:12:56,730
We don't need no soap opera.

208
00:12:56,787 --> 00:12:58,133
Yeah, man.
Whatever.

209
00:12:58,179 --> 00:12:59,915
No, no.
It's all good.

210
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:01,947
You know, I...
I'm just saying...

211
00:13:02,421 --> 00:13:04,514
Hey, I got...
I got plenty of pot.

212
00:13:04,687 --> 00:13:06,826
Yeah, I think
I'll bounce, man.

213
00:13:06,965 --> 00:13:08,734
Yeah, sounds about right.

214
00:13:09,382 --> 00:13:10,538
Hey, yo, yo.

215
00:13:10,678 --> 00:13:11,895
Hey, homes.

216
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,339
I'm joking.

217
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:16,133
Okay, I'm totally
joking with you.

218
00:13:17,053 --> 00:13:18,925
You kidding?
Sit down.

219
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,166
Best scante ever.

220
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:29,978
Grab that pipe.

221
00:16:47,095 --> 00:16:48,877
Do you need
some help?

222
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,014
No, I'm fine, honey.

223
00:16:53,141 --> 00:16:55,052
I'm fine. Just...

224
00:16:55,632 --> 00:16:56,804
Privacy.

225
00:16:57,129 --> 00:16:58,143
Thanks.

226
00:17:00,903 --> 00:17:03,102
I'm right outside
if you need me.

227
00:17:12,149 --> 00:17:14,785
Yeah, anytime on Friday
is absolutely fine.

228
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:17,311
Thank you so much
for working us in.

229
00:17:19,934 --> 00:17:22,289
Can I just put that
on a credit card?

230
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:23,804
Great.

231
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,895
Perfect.

232
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:27,425
Okay, so we will see you

233
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,876
at 10:45 on Friday morning.

234
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:32,456
Thank you so much.

235
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,877
Honey.

236
00:17:40,218 --> 00:17:42,241
The best oncologist...

237
00:17:42,334 --> 00:17:44,215
I mean, not even
just in New Mexico,

238
00:17:44,217 --> 00:17:47,265
but one of the top ten
in the entire nation...

239
00:17:47,488 --> 00:17:50,449
His name is Dr. Delcavoli.

240
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:52,758
And we see him on Friday.

241
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,282
I mean, Marie really
came through for us.

242
00:17:58,339 --> 00:18:00,432
She had her boss call and...

243
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:06,512
This is good.

244
00:18:07,751 --> 00:18:09,482
From here on out,
things are gonna...

245
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,942
What's that
we're putting on a credit card?

246
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:14,760
It's just a deposit
kind of thing.

247
00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:18,793
- How much of a deposit?
- It's $5,000.

248
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,406
Five thousand?

249
00:18:28,793 --> 00:18:30,745
And what's that?
Just to start?

250
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:33,039
Just to tell me
what I already know?

251
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:36,045
Walt, he's not
in our HMO, okay?

252
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:38,419
So be it.
We'll figure it out.

253
00:18:40,396 --> 00:18:43,488
Come on. Don't get hung up
on money here.

254
00:18:43,926 --> 00:18:45,899
We can always borrow
from Hank.

255
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:47,472
Absolutely not.

256
00:18:50,436 --> 00:18:51,591
No, I just...

257
00:18:51,966 --> 00:18:53,646
We're not gonna do that.

258
00:18:54,362 --> 00:18:56,667
Well, maybe we
can ask your mom.

259
00:18:58,991 --> 00:19:01,124
Have you even
called her yet?

260
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,771
Regardless,
you're gonna have to tell her.

261
00:19:06,777 --> 00:19:09,167
- I'm willing to do it...
- I'll call.

262
00:19:13,293 --> 00:19:16,110
I don't want us
thinking about money.

263
00:19:17,271 --> 00:19:20,454
Money is not the issue here.
It's not.

264
00:19:29,895 --> 00:19:32,026
I'll take care of the deposit.

265
00:19:38,183 --> 00:19:40,457
I'll borrow it
from my pension.

266
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:18,860
What's up?

267
00:20:22,961 --> 00:20:24,813
I thought I heard mice.

268
00:20:26,036 --> 00:20:27,858
That's all we need, huh?

269
00:20:29,805 --> 00:20:31,385
So, what's up, pal?

270
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,822
What the hell's
wrong with you?

271
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:38,146
What?

272
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:41,286
You're acting all...

273
00:20:45,091 --> 00:20:47,177
Why are you acting so...

274
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,886
weird?

275
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:53,222
You're acting like
nothing is going on.

276
00:22:45,835 --> 00:22:46,984
Come on!

277
00:22:47,898 --> 00:22:51,015
Am I gonna have to come down
there and whip your ass?

278
00:23:04,032 --> 00:23:07,598
And let me tell you something else.
I'm not doing this for charity, right?

279
00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:10,318
I'm the best he's got in that office.
He knows it, I know it.

280
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:13,021
I expect to be paid
to a level comens...

281
00:23:13,922 --> 00:23:17,274
I said, "Dave, do you think
40 grand is a proper bonus?"

282
00:23:17,515 --> 00:23:20,475
That's less than 10% of what
I booked for you guys this quarter.

283
00:23:20,477 --> 00:23:22,865
I'm not going to sit here
and be disrespected.

284
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:24,975
Oh, he's shitin bricks.

285
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:26,607
Oh, you know he is.

286
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,138
Yeah, that man lives in fear.
I'll go across town.

287
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,781
Hell, I could go anywhere.

288
00:23:30,884 --> 00:23:34,329
Hoffman-Gordon-Bradley or Sorcher,
even Goldberg-Wayne.

289
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:37,052
They'd make me a partner
just for walking in the damn door.

290
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:39,051
That's how ecstatic
they'd be.

291
00:23:39,515 --> 00:23:41,372
Hells, yes, brother-man!

292
00:23:42,787 --> 00:23:44,471
Check this chick out.

293
00:23:46,085 --> 00:23:46,976
Who?

294
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,014
Buddy, she's a cow.

295
00:23:50,826 --> 00:23:52,186
Stacey's a cow.

296
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,281
We're talking major
barnyard boo-hog.

297
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:59,546
Roll her in flour and look for the wet
spot before you hit that, man. You know?

298
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,821
Sir?

299
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,558
Sir?

300
00:24:09,378 --> 00:24:10,901
Sorry. Hi.

301
00:24:11,924 --> 00:24:13,833
- What can I do for you?
- Which dude?

302
00:24:13,893 --> 00:24:15,978
The dude that looked
like a lizard?

303
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,325
I'm sorry.

304
00:24:19,797 --> 00:24:23,687
I would like a cashier's check
in the full amount

305
00:24:23,981 --> 00:24:27,942
made out to Oncology Partners
of New Mexico, please.

306
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:33,115
Oh, that's O-N-C-O-L-O-G-Y.

307
00:24:34,054 --> 00:24:35,554
Yeah, you got it.

308
00:24:37,818 --> 00:24:39,920
I don't understand
why they're forcing you

309
00:24:39,923 --> 00:24:42,163
to choose between
the piccolo and the oboe.

310
00:24:42,202 --> 00:24:44,436
You show so much
promise with both.

311
00:24:44,495 --> 00:24:46,675
They can't have
any switching between woodwinds

312
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:49,258
because no matter how divided up,
someone would be left out.

313
00:24:49,266 --> 00:24:51,074
Well, rules are rules, I guess.

314
00:24:51,118 --> 00:24:53,206
Sure, rules and rules.
I'm all for that.

315
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,588
But I'm telling you,
you really shine on that oboe.

316
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,177
You have real talent,
and I'm not just saying that.

317
00:24:59,293 --> 00:25:00,324
Thanks.

318
00:25:01,455 --> 00:25:05,124
What about Mr. Pemberton? Is he
giving you enough individual attention?

319
00:25:05,126 --> 00:25:06,410
I'd have to say so.

320
00:25:06,444 --> 00:25:09,766
He tries to talk to each one of us
at least once during every practice.

321
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:11,858
That's good.
Feedback's important.

322
00:25:11,896 --> 00:25:13,605
It's key, I think.

323
00:25:14,551 --> 00:25:16,988
Hey, so how was
soccer practice?

324
00:25:21,075 --> 00:25:23,512
I think that
was in our backyard.

325
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:32,869
Who's there?

326
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:42,166
What the hell are you
doing out here?

327
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:46,436
Hey, Dad.

328
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:49,257
Hey, Mom.

329
00:25:51,526 --> 00:25:53,729
You got new patio furniture.

330
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:56,275
Right on!

331
00:26:00,086 --> 00:26:01,187
My leg.

332
00:27:07,048 --> 00:27:09,268
What do you think
it could be?

333
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,753
God knows
I'm no expert.

334
00:27:12,991 --> 00:27:15,264
I don't know.
Uppers, downers?

335
00:27:15,366 --> 00:27:16,942
Your guess
is as good as mine.

336
00:27:16,954 --> 00:27:20,018
I think we should check
his arms for needle marks.

337
00:27:24,012 --> 00:27:25,652
Do we let him stay?

338
00:27:26,323 --> 00:27:29,205
The Presbyterian Church
has those meetings.

339
00:27:29,575 --> 00:27:31,568
So maybe on condition,
you know?

340
00:27:31,598 --> 00:27:33,527
If he agrees to attend?

341
00:27:34,482 --> 00:27:36,990
I just don't know
what to tell Jake.

342
00:27:46,424 --> 00:27:47,614
Good evening.

343
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:50,452
Well, sleep well?

344
00:27:51,622 --> 00:27:54,312
What time's, uh...
What time is dinner?

345
00:27:56,046 --> 00:27:57,457
In about an hour.

346
00:28:01,364 --> 00:28:04,392
You know, I could wash
those clothes if you'd like.

347
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:06,530
They look a little lived in.

348
00:28:07,756 --> 00:28:08,991
No, that's cool.

349
00:28:09,327 --> 00:28:10,710
Maybe later.

350
00:28:15,883 --> 00:28:17,722
We are not doing this again.

351
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,120
- Adam...
- No.

352
00:28:19,617 --> 00:28:22,864
We said we'd lay down the law,
we lay down the law.

353
00:28:22,906 --> 00:28:25,491
We just have to be
consistent about it.

354
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:17,885
You're not taking the bus?

355
00:29:21,574 --> 00:29:23,413
All right, well, listen.

356
00:29:24,212 --> 00:29:27,696
Give me maybe another 20 minutes
and we'll get out of here.

357
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,000
All right.

358
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:32,811
Yeah, good.

359
00:30:04,132 --> 00:30:07,671
You know,
I just think that...

360
00:30:10,845 --> 00:30:13,960
things have a way
of working themselves out.

361
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,944
When did you get this?

362
00:30:41,355 --> 00:30:43,673
Last May at
the year-end assembly.

363
00:30:43,783 --> 00:30:46,759
They gave me that one, too.
The one on the end.

364
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:51,189
Environmental
Consciousness Award.

365
00:30:51,876 --> 00:30:55,425
What's that mean?
You, like, recycle cans and shit?

366
00:30:56,027 --> 00:30:58,723
I contacted the Albuquerque Journal
and asked what chemicals

367
00:30:58,725 --> 00:31:02,172
they use to bleach their paper. They
wound up writing an article about it.

368
00:31:02,244 --> 00:31:03,978
Right on, little bro!

369
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:07,190
Making mad in-roads
with the business community.

370
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,471
All right!

371
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,566
Now, hey, remember,

372
00:31:10,948 --> 00:31:14,098
not all learning
comes out of books.

373
00:31:18,422 --> 00:31:19,641
Look at you.

374
00:31:20,876 --> 00:31:23,265
We should hang out more often.

375
00:31:23,536 --> 00:31:25,131
You know, just...

376
00:31:25,443 --> 00:31:27,411
just kick back and chill.

377
00:31:27,998 --> 00:31:29,584
I mean, if you ever,

378
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,186
like, I don't know,
need advice.

379
00:31:33,472 --> 00:31:36,951
Because, yo, I mean,
I've been through it all. For real.

380
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:41,923
Hey, man, you...

381
00:31:42,462 --> 00:31:44,150
You play the flute?

382
00:31:44,746 --> 00:31:46,393
It's a piccolo, actually.

383
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,137
Dude, play some...
play some Jethro Tull.

384
00:31:51,896 --> 00:31:53,057
Hey, guys.

385
00:31:53,065 --> 00:31:54,730
How we doing in here?

386
00:31:55,435 --> 00:31:56,537
We're good.

387
00:32:00,684 --> 00:32:01,967
Yeah. Fine, Mom.

388
00:32:02,105 --> 00:32:03,760
Well, that's good.

389
00:32:04,194 --> 00:32:05,817
That's... That's great.

390
00:32:14,478 --> 00:32:15,626
What the hell?

391
00:32:16,223 --> 00:32:17,489
You see this?

392
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:21,135
What, am I some criminal
or something?

393
00:32:21,545 --> 00:32:23,428
- Whatever.
- Whatever?

394
00:32:24,394 --> 00:32:26,537
What, you think that's okay?

395
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:29,186
Like, "Oh, we can't
let that scumbag

396
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,789
"warp the mind of
our favorite son."

397
00:32:32,624 --> 00:32:34,178
I'm the favorite?

398
00:32:35,235 --> 00:32:36,477
Yeah, right.

399
00:32:37,158 --> 00:32:40,158
You're practically
all they ever talk about.

400
00:34:17,165 --> 00:34:18,547
Oh, snap.

401
00:34:20,962 --> 00:34:22,016
Awesome.

402
00:34:56,923 --> 00:34:58,291
Yo, man, it's me.

403
00:34:58,723 --> 00:35:01,280
Hey, listen.
You know, that product?

404
00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:04,104
You got any more of that?

405
00:35:04,263 --> 00:35:06,648
Nah, man, okay?
I'm done giving out freebies.

406
00:35:06,652 --> 00:35:09,046
You want charity,
go ask the Salvation Army.

407
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,625
No, no charity.

408
00:35:10,957 --> 00:35:13,541
I got this cousin,
he's got him some rich friends.

409
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,411
These dudes are in town.
They're looking to par-tay.

410
00:35:16,585 --> 00:35:19,544
And your stuff is,
like, so sweet.

411
00:35:20,004 --> 00:35:21,600
So what do you say?

412
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,706
You up for making
some fat stacks?

413
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:27,358
Because they'll buy
everything you got.

414
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:48,385
You can't be serious.

415
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:51,712
What the hell
are you doing here?

416
00:35:51,746 --> 00:35:53,816
Yo, I waited till
the bowl buster left.

417
00:35:53,873 --> 00:35:55,842
I mean, no offense.

418
00:35:58,359 --> 00:35:59,562
Who sent you?

419
00:36:00,573 --> 00:36:03,075
You wearing a wire?
You setting me up?

420
00:36:04,296 --> 00:36:05,921
A wire?
You want a wire?

421
00:36:05,981 --> 00:36:08,569
I got a wire.
Speak into the mic, bitch!

422
00:36:08,854 --> 00:36:11,513
What the hell's wrong
with you? A wire.

423
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,406
So who did you tell about...

424
00:36:17,548 --> 00:36:20,990
- Nobody. What are you, nuts?
- Then why are you here?

425
00:36:23,123 --> 00:36:24,459
I don't know.

426
00:36:25,073 --> 00:36:26,161
To, like...

427
00:36:26,624 --> 00:36:27,951
touch base.

428
00:36:28,865 --> 00:36:30,159
Touch base?

429
00:36:31,247 --> 00:36:32,726
Yeah, you know...

430
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:34,817
what you call...

431
00:36:35,513 --> 00:36:36,760
a debrief?

432
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:38,997
Maybe we could, like...

433
00:36:39,255 --> 00:36:41,218
I thought we could debrief.

434
00:36:41,321 --> 00:36:42,510
Debrief?

435
00:36:43,482 --> 00:36:44,638
Wow, that's...

436
00:36:45,222 --> 00:36:47,987
that's what you think we need,
to debrief?

437
00:36:50,426 --> 00:36:54,358
Yeah, after what happened,
it just seems like the thing to do.

438
00:36:54,835 --> 00:36:56,888
Kind of, you know,
talk about it.

439
00:36:56,971 --> 00:36:59,701
We can't talk to anybody else.

440
00:37:01,331 --> 00:37:03,974
Anyway, that,
and I wanted to...

441
00:37:04,325 --> 00:37:07,443
I wanted to tell you
how much everybody digs

442
00:37:08,122 --> 00:37:09,927
that meth we cooked.

443
00:37:10,056 --> 00:37:11,887
Everybody digs the meth...

444
00:37:12,392 --> 00:37:13,658
we cooked.

445
00:37:14,874 --> 00:37:16,414
Seriously, I got...

446
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:20,097
dudes that would give
their left nut for a little more.

447
00:37:21,115 --> 00:37:21,978
Great.

448
00:37:21,983 --> 00:37:24,254
I'm just saying, if you ever...

449
00:37:25,188 --> 00:37:28,219
saw your way clear to...

450
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,841
You know, you and I...

451
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,447
cooking a little more.

452
00:37:42,265 --> 00:37:44,045
Get the hell off my property.

453
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:47,316
- What? I'm just saying.
- Go and don't come back.

454
00:37:47,628 --> 00:37:48,612
Now!

455
00:37:51,105 --> 00:37:52,123
All right.

456
00:37:53,267 --> 00:37:54,559
You know what?

457
00:37:55,346 --> 00:37:56,641
Four grand.

458
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,421
Your share
from selling that batch.

459
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,961
That's why I'm here.

460
00:38:04,963 --> 00:38:06,533
Yeah, that's right.

461
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:08,659
I didn't smoke it all.

462
00:38:34,223 --> 00:38:36,573
Non-small cell adenocarcinoma.

463
00:38:36,891 --> 00:38:38,260
Stage 3a,

464
00:38:38,268 --> 00:38:41,567
which means it's spread
from the lung to the lymph nodes.

465
00:38:41,658 --> 00:38:44,137
There's no denying
it's very serious.

466
00:38:44,926 --> 00:38:46,248
But is it...

467
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:48,942
It is...

468
00:38:50,312 --> 00:38:51,437
curable?

469
00:38:52,325 --> 00:38:54,475
I prefer the word "treatable."

470
00:38:55,365 --> 00:38:58,833
But the treatments we have at our
disposal can be very effective.

471
00:38:58,861 --> 00:39:01,038
Without making any promises,
I can tell you that

472
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:04,442
the specific course of radiation
and chemotherapy I'm going to suggest

473
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,143
has been successful.

474
00:39:06,168 --> 00:39:10,107
In certain cases, it prolonged patients'
lives and even resulted in remission.

475
00:39:12,542 --> 00:39:14,924
What about
the side effects?

476
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:18,859
Well, they can be mild
to practically non-existent,

477
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:20,990
or they can be
pretty darn awful.

478
00:39:21,005 --> 00:39:22,809
It varies from patient to patient.

479
00:39:22,832 --> 00:39:24,733
Typically, there's hair loss,

480
00:39:24,797 --> 00:39:28,635
which begins a couple of weeks
after the start of chemotherapy.

481
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,269
You may find yourself unusually
fatigued, not much energy.

482
00:39:32,298 --> 00:39:34,160
You won't want
to get out of bed.

483
00:39:34,169 --> 00:39:38,059
You may lose weight due to reduced
appetite and certain intestinal issues.

484
00:39:38,374 --> 00:39:41,763
Muscle aches and pains,
gums get sore and bleed.

485
00:39:41,945 --> 00:39:45,573
And, of course,
there's the possibility of nausea.

486
00:39:46,029 --> 00:39:49,675
Although, we'll prescribe an anti-emetic
and try to counteract that.

487
00:39:49,781 --> 00:39:51,648
Possible kidney
or bladder irritation.

488
00:39:51,653 --> 00:39:54,446
You may wind up with
increased bruising and bleeding.

489
00:39:54,487 --> 00:39:57,000
There may be sexual side effects.

490
00:39:57,046 --> 00:39:59,742
Your skin may become
dry and irritated...

491
00:40:28,636 --> 00:40:30,300
Got anything to say?

492
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:39,547
What do you know
about that?

493
00:40:40,546 --> 00:40:43,356
- Nothing.
- That's not going to fly this time.

494
00:40:43,385 --> 00:40:45,918
How many chances
have we given you?

495
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,761
How many times
have we sat right here

496
00:40:48,819 --> 00:40:51,021
and had the same conversation
over and over again

497
00:40:51,023 --> 00:40:53,821
where you look us in the eye
and you plead ignorance,

498
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,872
and you play
on our emotions,

499
00:40:55,904 --> 00:40:58,609
and you tell us anything
you think we want to hear

500
00:40:58,613 --> 00:41:01,468
just so we'll give you
another chance?

501
00:41:01,641 --> 00:41:05,306
And it makes us feel
like fools, every time.

502
00:41:10,023 --> 00:41:11,491
Enough, Jesse.

503
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:13,982
Enough.

504
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:18,037
We are not going
to have this in our house.

505
00:41:19,391 --> 00:41:21,147
We need you to leave.

506
00:42:01,297 --> 00:42:03,397
Thanks for not telling on me.

507
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,450
You think
I could have it back?

508
00:42:25,174 --> 00:42:26,962
It's skunk weed anyway.

509
00:42:51,506 --> 00:42:54,297
You know,
this is actually very hopeful.

510
00:43:00,852 --> 00:43:02,319
Did you hear me?

511
00:43:02,523 --> 00:43:05,875
I said this is really
very, very hopeful.

512
00:43:11,033 --> 00:43:14,385
Can I call them and tell them
you'll start next week?

513
00:43:29,627 --> 00:43:32,066
I just think that we need to...

514
00:43:32,669 --> 00:43:34,806
discuss it a little more,
that's all.

515
00:43:34,814 --> 00:43:37,127
What is there to discuss?

516
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,344
You're going to get
the best treatment

517
00:43:39,443 --> 00:43:41,155
and he's the best.

518
00:43:41,215 --> 00:43:43,127
Well, there's the money discussion.

519
00:43:43,129 --> 00:43:46,570
$90,000 out of pocket.

520
00:43:46,733 --> 00:43:48,965
- Maybe more.
- There's a way, Walt.

521
00:43:48,981 --> 00:43:52,656
There's financing,
there's installment plans.

522
00:43:52,788 --> 00:43:54,878
I could always go back to work.

523
00:43:54,979 --> 00:43:57,055
Walt, there's always a way.

524
00:43:57,085 --> 00:43:58,132
All right.

525
00:43:58,529 --> 00:44:01,295
Skyler, say that
there is a way.

526
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:04,282
And we spend
all that money, and...

527
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:19,881
Am I supposed to leave you
with all that debt?

528
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:26,715
I just don't want
emotions ruling us.

529
00:44:28,373 --> 00:44:30,953
Maybe treatment
isn't the way to go.

530
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:35,787
Then why don't you just
fucking die already?

531
00:44:38,919 --> 00:44:40,784
Just give up and die.

532
00:45:30,876 --> 00:45:32,610
Come on, move your ass.

533
00:45:35,922 --> 00:45:37,362
What do I care?

534
00:45:38,604 --> 00:45:41,791
Yeah, I'm not worried.
I have the best fucking attorney.

535
00:45:42,236 --> 00:45:44,954
I would not want to be
on the other side of this one...

536
00:47:04,005 --> 00:47:05,371
What the hell?

537
00:47:12,226 --> 00:47:15,671
What are you doing?
Call somebody, call the fire people.

538
00:47:17,803 --> 00:47:20,730
I don't believe it.
You know how much I paid for that?

539
00:47:25,543 --> 00:47:27,277
Why is it doing this?

1
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:47,589
So cigarettes and gas is $79.70.

2
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,051
Crap.

3
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,262
There's an ATM right outside.

4
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,849
Yeah, I don't have a card.

5
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:00,978
Well, you can write a personal cheque
with ID.

6
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,857
Kind of in between banks right now.

7
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,819
You think I could just
come back later?

8
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,030
I'm totally good for it.
I'd come back, I swear.

9
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:18,161
If it were me, I'd be totally,
you know, "No problem."

10
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,206
But my dad is
this ginormous hard-ass.

11
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,750
He was in Fallujah for a year.

12
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:27,504
And he always checks the receipts.
I mean, like, always.

13
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,756
I gotta call him. I'm sorry.

14
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,341
Wait, wait, wait.

15
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,720
Hold on a second.

16
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,182
Maybe we could...

17
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,851
...trade.

18
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,317
Ever try it?

19
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,280
I mean, I smoke pot a lot sometimes.

20
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,324
I party.

21
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:56,867
But...

22
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,078
- But that stuff's really addictive, right?
- Not really.

23
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,707
It's just a media thing. You know?

24
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,630
What's it like?

25
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,261
It's awesome.

26
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:23,185
Everything's maximum interesting.

27
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:30,609
You get these really cold
and sharp-like action dagger feelings.

28
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,031
It's awesome.

29
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,661
Come on. What do you say?

30
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,404
Have a nice day.

31
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,820
So how does it feel?

32
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,572
Does it hurt?

33
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,116
Yeah, it's tight.

34
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:04,620
- Yeah, but is it painful?
- It's hard to breathe.

35
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,123
Well, you need your breathing.

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,044
Although let's not lose sight
of the fact...

37
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,672
...that you were the victim
of a terrible accident, Antonio...

38
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,383
...so some discomfort is
to be... expected.

39
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,892
Let's go with that one.

40
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,315
A cashier's chequ<i>e, por fav or.</i>

41
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:37,569
Oh, and spread the word.
I'm building a class-action, flight 515.

42
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,363
Victims' families would be great.

43
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:42,241
I'll take anyone on the ground
who suffered emotionally.

44
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:45,577
Anxiety, sleeplessness.
You get the picture.

45
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,120
Trouble?

46
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,707
<i>Ted Benek e? You cannot be serious.</i>

47
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:54,211
<i>- That guy is a jok e.</i>
<i>- You know what? You called my bluff.</i>

48
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,629
<i>What does that even mean?</i>

49
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:58,966
<i>You dared me to tell the police</i>
<i>and I couldn't do it, so you win.</i>

50
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:02,594
<i>If you want to stay in this house, fine,</i>
<i>but we are not married anymore.</i>

51
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:06,139
<i>I told you that</i>
<i>I was done cooking meth, Skyler.</i>

52
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,891
<i>- I promised you that.</i>
- <i>So what?</i>

53
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,519
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>At least I didn't run off to go...</i>

54
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,981
<i>Jesus! I mean, everything that I did,</i>
<i>I did for this family.</i>

55
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,276
<i>- Just k eep telling yourself that.</i>
<i>- What is that supposed to mean?</i>

56
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,152
<i>You don't lik e it, then leave.</i>

57
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,656
<i>- And tak e your drug money with you.</i>
<i>- That's what you want.</i>

58
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:27,995
- Jesus.
- Garbage disposal.

59
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,997
<i>You think this will get me</i>
<i>to move out?</i>

60
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,958
<i>You can screw Ted. You can screw</i>
<i>the butcher, the mailman.</i>

61
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,585
<i>- God, Walt.</i>
<i>- Whoever you want.</i>

62
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,462
<i>Screw them all.</i>
<i>I'm not going anywhere.</i>

63
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,381
<i>Suit yourself.</i>

64
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,176
Is this a good or bad thing?

65
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,929
<i>Suit myself.</i>
<i>You want me to suit myself?</i>

66
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:47,890
<i>I'll suit myself to his face!</i>

67
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,225
It's a bad thing.

68
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,613
Hello.

69
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,574
Walter White to see Ted Beneke.

70
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,786
I'm sorry.
Mr. Beneke's on a conference call.

71
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,790
Okay. I will wait.

72
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,876
It could be a while.

73
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,046
I have all the time in the world.

74
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,697
Okay.

75
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,493
- Here we go. Okay.
- Excuse me.

76
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,828
- Mr. Beneke's not available.
- Ted? Come on.

77
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,705
Sir, excuse me.

78
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,291
Excuse me.

79
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,168
Ted, I can see you.

80
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,796
I can see you standing right there
in your office.

81
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,047
Now, come on.

82
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,094
Open the door. Come on, let's talk.
I just want to talk. That's all.

83
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,888
Come on, let's be men about this.
Okay? How about that?

84
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,560
Hey, Walt. I'm kind of in the middle
of something now.

85
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,436
Oh, yes, you are.

86
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,355
So open the door.

87
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,858
You're damn right.
You're right in the middle.

88
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,485
Just open the door
and let's talk about it, okay?

89
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,821
Open the door, Ted, right now.

90
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:30,993
You don't want to be a man about it?
Plan B. How do you like that? Plan B.

91
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,037
We have a situation.

92
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,712
Walt. Walt. Walt.

93
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,131
What are you doing?

94
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,008
I'm talking with Ted.

95
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:01,773
Next time, you'll open the door.

96
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,611
- Freeze! Come on.
- Oh, damn it.

97
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,154
No, I'm just here to talk.

98
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,615
- I just want to talk to him.
- Outside. Let's go.

99
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:13,368
God. Can I just talk?
I just want to talk to him.

100
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,537
- Calm down.
- I'm just... Okay, all right.

101
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:18,999
All right, all right, all right.
I'm calm. I'm calm.

102
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,502
Asshole.

103
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,356
What do you want?
What do you want?

104
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,442
Hey! Hey, come on.

105
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,321
What the hell is wrong with you?

106
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,949
You act like you're the first guy
this happened to.

107
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:55,744
I caught my second wife screwing
my stepdad, okay?

108
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:59,206
It's a cruel world, Walt. Grow up.

109
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:03,460
- I just wanted to talk to him.
- Yeah, well, now I'm talking to you.

110
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,546
Consider this an inte... ntion.

111
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,507
You could have been arrested
back there. You understand.

112
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,718
Speaking as your lawyer,
I'm always looking for billable hours.

113
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,137
But speaking as
your business associate...

114
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:17,140
...I'm strongly advising
that you get your shit together.

115
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,604
Just cool it with this Beneke guy,
at least for now. Okay?

116
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:27,651
Let's talk shop, because
I think this is a great opportunity...

117
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,530
...to channel some of that negative
energy into something positive.

118
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,741
- How did you know?
- Sorry?

119
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,494
About Skyler.
About where to find me just now.

120
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:39,621
How did you know?

121
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:43,709
That's just my meticulousness.
Don't bog down in detail, Walt.

122
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,962
- The lesson here should be...
- Did you bug my house?

123
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,719
Yeah, but I didn't know it was
your house, did I?

124
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,513
You'd moved out.
Besides, you basically told me to.

125
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:59,683
- I told you to?
- You strongly hinted that I should.

126
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:03,896
You were worried your wife might say
something to the police.

127
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:08,650
What? No, no, that's not true.
When the hell did I say that?

128
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,445
Let's not get lost in the who,
what and whens.

129
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:15,866
The point is we did our due diligence
and she didn't talk.

130
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,076
She kept quiet.
She stood by you, Walt...

131
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:22,206
...which, if you ask me,
is the ironical silver lining here.

132
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,208
I mean, on the one hand...

133
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:29,171
...sure, she snuck off the reservation
to get some dirty, damp and deep.

134
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,631
On the other hand...

135
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,101
Off me.

136
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,732
You're fired!

137
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:50,317
- You're done!
- Good!

138
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:52,277
"Oh, boohoo,
I won't cook meth anymore".

139
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,321
You're a crybaby. Who needs you?

140
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,199
I'm unplugging the website,
so no more money laundering.

141
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,408
How do you like that?

142
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:01,286
I want those bugs
out of my house today.

143
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,705
I want them out now!

144
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:07,668
You just bought a $300 suit, psycho!

145
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,671
Go.

146
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,096
Great, drilled right into the stucco.

147
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:24,434
A little bit of putty, you'll be fine.

148
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,647
Just make sure
you get all of those things.

149
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:33,151
A, these things cost $800 apiece.

150
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,862
B, you're not that interesting.

151
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,115
So yeah, I'll get all of them, Walter.

152
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:43,787
Great line of work, by the way.
Real upstanding field.

153
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,831
Yeah, well...

154
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,543
...I enjoy it.

155
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,638
You're free to leave now. Anytime.

156
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,934
You know, Walter...

157
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:10,480
...sometimes it doesn't hurt
to have someone watching your back.

158
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,103
Mr. White?

159
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,277
Hi.

160
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,822
What's up?

161
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:49,788
I can't begin to understand
what you're going through, Walt...

162
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:54,960
...with all of your health concerns
and the stresses you've been under.

163
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:56,753
But still, as educators...

164
00:13:56,962 --> 00:14:00,966
...there are certain responsibilities
we need to be meeting here...

165
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,886
...to the school
and to the students themselves.

166
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,637
Of course.

167
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,475
Is this a wheaten terrier?

168
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,062
Norfolk.

169
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,106
Norfolk?

170
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,775
That's surprising.

171
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:23,572
Walt, could you come back over here
and have a seat, please?

172
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:25,949
Sure.

173
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:40,255
You've been absent a lot recently.

174
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:45,552
And when you are here at school, there
have been some behavioural questions.

175
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,222
And frankly I'm concerned.

176
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,726
Thank you.

177
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,403
Are you feeling okay?

178
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,616
Do you think maybe
I should call Skyler?

179
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,537
No.

180
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:21,213
Let's just keep this...

181
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,048
What...?

182
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,760
Hey!

183
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,264
Walt, what's wrong with you?

184
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:15,684
You know, look, you're the one
always talking about D.C., okay?

185
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:17,561
This is how you get there.

186
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,689
You answer the bell.
You pay your dues.

187
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:28,363
Besides, you know,
it's a big deal to get picked for this.

188
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:33,535
El Paso's like the Super Bowl.

189
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,873
I could get killed crossing the street,
okay?

190
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:41,293
Whatever. You know, I want to go.

191
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,754
What about last time?

192
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:45,964
What about last time?

193
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,656
Schrader.

194
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,700
Hey, sheriff. Yeah.

195
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,204
Blue, huh?

196
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:22,501
Yeah, yeah. Thing is...

197
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,255
Thing is I'm supposed to be getting
on a plane right now.

198
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:34,304
The stuff this guy had was blue.
You sure about that?

199
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:38,976
Yeah.

200
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,979
Yeah, I want to talk to him.

201
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:46,650
Taxi.

202
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:27,941
- Hi.
- Man, I'm sorry.

203
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,445
I needed to talk to you,
but you weren't at your apartment.

204
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:33,989
No, I moved back home.

205
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,158
That's good, right?

206
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:38,368
Yeah.

207
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:41,663
- Yo, did you just get fired?
- No.

208
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,374
No, no, no.

209
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:46,919
It's more like a sabbatical.

210
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:50,047
Indefinite. Yeah.

211
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:07,189
So, what's up?

212
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,900
Should we go somewhere?

213
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,278
No, this is fine.

214
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:19,159
So I want an intro to your guy.

215
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:20,786
What guy?

216
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:25,332
Your guy. Your distribution guy.
The guy Saul hooked you up with.

217
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,668
No, no, no. Come on, Jesse.

218
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:32,381
- I thought about it and I want to.
- God.

219
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,341
It's the one thing I'm good at.

220
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,219
No, that is just not true.

221
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,972
You're good at a lot of things, son.

222
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,515
Like what?

223
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:46,645
What about your sobriety?

224
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,857
I told you, I'm not using.

225
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:51,900
Ever.

226
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:55,821
I just want back into the business.

227
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:03,328
Well, I don't. I'm sorry.

228
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,664
I know, and that's cool.

229
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:09,459
I'm not asking you to cook.

230
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:13,422
What's this?

231
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:18,468
In the... end, I just went with
two reflux condensers.

232
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:21,138
I didn't want to lose track
of my pH levels.

233
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:25,309
But I did everything else
just like you taught me.

234
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,937
Super careful in my amounts...

235
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:32,649
...and watched the numbers
every step of the way.

236
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:37,029
So, what do you think?
It's good, right?

237
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:44,953
What in the hell is this?

238
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,372
- What?
- What?

239
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:51,043
This. This. This is my product.

240
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,712
This is my formula. This is mine.

241
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:58,217
It's our product,
but yeah, I was gonna cut you in.

242
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,052
Oh, you were gonna cut me in?

243
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:02,679
No, no, no. I cut you in.

244
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:06,683
What the hell is your problem?
All I'm asking is for you to set a meet.

245
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:09,770
- Absolutely not.
- Why?

246
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,775
Because I am not gonna lend my name
to an inferior product.

247
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:17,319
I mean, look at the diameters here.

248
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:19,279
What did you use for reduction?

249
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,366
Don't tell me. Platinum dioxide, right?

250
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:25,661
No. Mercury-aluminium amalgam.

251
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,996
The dioxide's too hard to keep wet.

252
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:31,458
All right, well,
you must've done it wrong, then.

253
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:35,462
Your colour is all cloudy, so you were
struggling with distillation too.

254
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:38,382
Now, this is very shoddy work,
Pinkman.

255
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,509
I'm actually embarrassed for you.

256
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:42,302
What?

257
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:47,015
No way. I gave out samples
and everyone said it was the bomb.

258
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:50,644
Oh, they said it was the bomb.

259
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:53,814
And who were they, I wonder?
A bunch of meth heads?

260
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:55,023
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

261
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,901
- They should know, right?
- Yeah, well, sorry.

262
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:00,362
- I can't help you.
- Fine, ass-wad.

263
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:03,574
- I'll contact the guy myself.
- Oh, yeah? Well, good luck.

264
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:07,035
Because my guy is a pro
and he doesn't deal with junkies.

265
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:09,955
- You know what? Eat me.
- Anytime, loser.

266
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,248
Hey, hey, hey!

267
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:14,459
Wait. Hey!

268
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:56,168
I can't believe it's only 4:00.

269
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:00,631
This day is dragging.

270
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:10,974
Okay.

271
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:40,170
I wish I could stay.

272
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:42,923
So stay.

273
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:47,886
What's stopping you?

274
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:53,433
What, like... everything, you mean?

275
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:57,688
How about my lunatic husband
refusing to leave the house?

276
00:24:00,274 --> 00:24:02,109
So move in here.

277
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:08,031
And then my son hating me
even more.

278
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,952
That'll pass.
I went through that with the girls.

279
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,579
They adapt.

280
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:18,500
And now everyone at work thinks
I'm an evil ladder-climbing whore.

281
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:21,420
They're all fired,
effective immediately.

282
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,213
What else?

283
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:27,634
Oh, aren't you the answer man?

284
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,849
Where did it...?

285
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:39,980
Where did it go wrong, exactly,
with you and Walt?

286
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:47,654
I mean, I always saw him as kind of...

287
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,242
...mild-mannered.

288
00:24:53,202 --> 00:24:57,122
Something, I don't know,
change when he got sick or...?

289
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:00,834
I don't know what changed, Ted.

290
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:05,172
And I just don't feel really comfortable
talking about it.

291
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:07,299
Sorry.

292
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,719
Just asking out of self-interest.

293
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:13,597
Gotta make sure
I don't make the same mistake.

294
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,851
I would be amazed.

295
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:23,190
Just let me see if
I'm following you here, Russell.

296
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:28,153
You got this stuff from some guy
at Gasparza's...

297
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:30,155
...who was wearing tan pants...

298
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:34,493
...and who you're 80 percent sure
had a moustache.

299
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,078
That's it, right?

300
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:40,123
That's your brain
working at maximum capacity?

301
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:48,590
Russell.

302
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,927
Everything all right in there?

303
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:56,849
Mel. The dude's name was Mel.

304
00:25:57,349 --> 00:26:01,520
Well, there you go. See?
You served an actual earthly function.

305
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,564
I can't believe I remembered that.

306
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:07,776
Mel who?
Does he have a last name?

307
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:10,195
Yeah, Mel.

308
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:13,240
Wait.

309
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,868
Was it Mel...

310
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:18,495
...or Mark?

311
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:21,707
It was definitely an M name.

312
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:24,001
Oh, man, I'm losing it.

313
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:26,628
Wait, wait.

314
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:30,340
Yeah.

315
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:33,302
It's gone.

316
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,845
It's gone.

317
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:37,264
- It was an M name though.
- Yeah.

318
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:40,350
I remember the... sound.

319
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:46,315
All right, well,
we'll go with the... sound.

320
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,192
- Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
- Yeah.

321
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,402
He definitely had tan pants.

322
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:55,574
Remind me to get a vasectomy.

323
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:58,452
Okay, it's after 9,
so this bar that Girl George is at...

324
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,579
...probably wall-to-wall dirtbags
by now.

325
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:06,168
Let's go have a little looky-loo,
see if we can't find this M-named clown.

326
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:12,174
What? It's a lead.

327
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:15,177
- Lead to what?
- To Heisenberg.

328
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:18,805
I told you it was only a matter of time
before this guy booted up again.

329
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:20,933
Here we go, my friend.

330
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:23,143
Don't hate me because I'm beautiful,
Gomey.

331
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:26,271
Just apologise and buy me a beer.

332
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:29,316
Man, you're reaching.

333
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:33,612
This stuff could be a knockoff
or left over from an older cook.

334
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,406
How do you know Heisenberg's
gearing up again?

335
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:39,159
How do I know?

336
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:42,037
Because I know.

337
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:43,622
I don't get it.

338
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:47,125
This is the reason why
you're blowing off the task force?

339
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:49,169
Chase down teeners?

340
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:53,006
I'm getting tired
of all the second-guessing.

341
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:56,927
If you're not sufficiently stimulated
by this investigation...

342
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,346
...do us both a favour
and ask for a transfer.

343
00:27:59,555 --> 00:28:01,890
What is up with you lately?

344
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:05,811
Starting bar fights,
turning down El Paso...

345
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,354
...and now this bullshit?

346
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:10,524
Do you need to talk to someone
or what?

347
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:12,901
Talk to someone?

348
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,362
Talk to who?

349
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:22,786
I'm not trying to step on your toes,
bro. Okay?

350
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:25,622
I'm just worried about you.
That's all.

351
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:29,126
Appreciate that, bro.

352
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:32,504
Now take your hand off my shoulder.

353
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:48,979
Yeah, yeah, the one that was on TV.

354
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:52,149
Did any little piece
fall on your property?

355
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:55,319
I'm not looking for an entire wing here,
Mr. Linkas.

356
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:58,530
It could be a nut or a bolt.
It could be a bag of peanuts...

357
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:01,867
...just so long as it caused you
pain and suffering.

358
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:04,578
Oh, no, no, no. Closed.
Calling you back.

359
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:08,040
You had your chance.
I told you to get him cooking again.

360
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:12,085
You blew it off and now it's too late.
The guy's gone mass maniac on us!

361
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:14,588
All I wanted was to show you two
your potential.

362
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:17,049
And what do I get in return?
A bone contusion.

363
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:20,552
You wanna see the scar?
I wish you two had...

364
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:22,429
Hi, there.

365
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,226
- How in the hell did you get Walt to...?
- I made it.

366
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:30,687
You know the guy
who knows the guy, right?

367
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:05,514
Well, good news is...

368
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:10,018
...for a stage-three cancer,
the guy's doing well physically.

369
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:12,312
Mentally, the guy's a disaster.

370
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:16,024
He's gone off the rails
over this thing with his wife.

371
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:21,154
My opinion, he's not coming back.
Not on his own.

372
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,870
Your friends were at his place again,
by the way.

373
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:31,248
They drew something on the street
outside his house.

374
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:35,460
- The scythe.
- Animals.

375
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:37,296
- Does the lawyer know?
- Should he?

376
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:39,089
No.

377
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:45,220
If you want this guy to produce again,
why not just tell him?

378
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:47,806
You stand between him
and an axe in the head.

379
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:50,517
I don't believe fear
to be an effective motivator.

380
00:30:50,726 --> 00:30:52,603
I want investment.

381
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:56,440
For now, I'm simply interested
in time frame.

382
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:59,526
He will live for the foreseeable future,
yes?

383
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:05,365
Foreseeable. Couple years at least,
barring acts of God and men with axes.

384
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:09,119
From the lawyer,
I'm supposed to let you know...

385
00:31:09,328 --> 00:31:11,997
...the Pinkman kid is looking to sell.

386
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:15,751
- I don't work with junkies.
- That's what I thought you'd say.

387
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,753
Probably for the best.

388
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:20,297
What I hear,
he and Walter are splitsville.

389
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:23,425
Really?

390
00:31:23,634 --> 00:31:27,054
That's what Goodman says.
Cats and dogs.

391
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:31,266
Do the deal.

392
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:01,648
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>

393
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:05,611
<i>Agent Schrader, you need to be calling</i>
<i>me back ASAP.</i>

394
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:09,448
<i>I've got Texas breathing down my neck</i>
<i>and I'm not about...</i>

395
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:34,723
No, I haven't see Matt since my dad
fired him, like, a while ago.

396
00:33:34,932 --> 00:33:36,808
Where can I find him, you think?

397
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:39,978
- No idea. Haven't seen him.
- I know. You said that a few times.

398
00:33:40,187 --> 00:33:44,733
Yeah, because I haven't seen him.
I don't know what else to say.

399
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:52,074
- What's your name, darling?
- Cara.

400
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,541
Where did this come from, Cara?

401
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,585
I don't know.

402
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,755
What is it? Drugs?

403
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:12,386
Look, I'm just gonna come right out
and say it.

404
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:15,472
You're a bad liar, Cara.

405
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:20,018
Don't get me wrong.
Not the worst I've... ever seen.

406
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:25,148
Once had a guy try to explain the dope
balloon up his butt on bad Thai food.

407
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:30,362
Still, you're not a very good liar.

408
00:34:31,113 --> 00:34:34,116
- I honestly don't know...
- Stop.

409
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:37,452
You look like a good kid.
I'm not here to get you in trouble.

410
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:41,540
But you need to tell me
where this came from right now!

411
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:49,673
I never do stuff like this.
I swear to God.

412
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:53,177
I tried it and I hated it,
so I just gave it to Matt.

413
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:55,345
- Okay, and who gave it to you?
- Some guy.

414
00:34:55,554 --> 00:34:59,600
He came in a couple days ago
and wanted to trade it for gas.

415
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:02,811
Some guy? What's his name?

416
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:07,274
Okay, what...? What did he look like?

417
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:11,069
I don't know.

418
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:13,238
He looked pretty normal.

419
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:15,824
You know, white.

420
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,873
I think his hair was lightish brown.

421
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:26,043
He had really blue... eyes.

422
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:28,545
They were really, really blue.

423
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:31,465
Yeah, yeah, yeah, dreamy.
Okay, what else?

424
00:35:31,673 --> 00:35:36,595
Piercings, jewellery, distinctive
articles of clothing. Come on.

425
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:39,181
Come on.

426
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:42,226
Listen to me.

427
00:35:42,518 --> 00:35:46,230
It's real important that I find the person
that had these drugs.

428
00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:49,733
So if you can remember
anything else...

429
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:55,948
Come on, think.
Come on, now. Come on.

430
00:35:57,866 --> 00:35:59,451
He drove an RV.

431
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,662
Okay, good, good.

432
00:36:02,246 --> 00:36:04,081
What can you remember?
What kind of RV?

433
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:07,125
What colour?
Did you spot a license plate?

434
00:36:07,543 --> 00:36:12,881
I don't know the kinds
and I didn't see the license.

435
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:19,096
But the colour was,
I think, white, brownish colour.

436
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:22,850
I'm sorry.

437
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:25,269
I know I'm not helping you...

438
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:29,857
...but, please, don't tell my dad.

439
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:40,826
Cara.

440
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:47,499
Please, tell me that
that camera works.

441
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:02,556
Damn it.

442
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:01,198
Bingo.

443
00:38:21,385 --> 00:38:23,512
These... eggs are good, Mom.

444
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:25,514
Thanks.

445
00:38:27,683 --> 00:38:30,853
Hey, you know what's weird?
Dad's website.

446
00:38:31,061 --> 00:38:33,897
It's been three days
since the last donation.

447
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:41,488
Yeah, well, people lose interest.

448
00:38:55,502 --> 00:38:58,338
So how long are you off for?

449
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:04,303
A few weeks.

450
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:07,306
I'll play it by ear.

451
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:16,106
I probably pushed it, you know,
going back to work too soon.

452
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:29,578
Think I can get a ride today?
Louis has a doctor's appointment.

453
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:34,124
Yeah.

454
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:43,258
Hey, so, Dad can babysit now, right?

455
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:48,263
You won't have to take Holly
to work every day.

456
00:39:56,605 --> 00:39:59,566
Sometime, maybe.

457
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:03,403
Yeah, we'll see.

458
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:47,489
What's up?

459
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:55,122
I think you'll seriously enjoy, yo.

460
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:15,517
Wait. No, no. No way.

461
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:21,023
Hey! Hey!

462
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:26,278
Hey. What the hell? This is only half.

463
00:41:26,486 --> 00:41:29,239
That's right. It's your half.

464
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:35,996
Yo, where's the other half, bitch?

465
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:41,335
I mean, the whole thing was crazy.
Poor bastard. I felt sorry for him.

466
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:45,464
I think he actually thought
we were the cable guys, you know.

467
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:51,178
Anyway, sorry about
those missed calls, chief.

468
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:53,514
I'm changing providers.
It won't happen again.

469
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:57,559
Are you going to El Paso, Hank?

470
00:41:57,768 --> 00:42:01,063
Hell, yes.
With pointy boots and bells on.

471
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:03,065
Got this break in the Heisenberg case.

472
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:06,193
The blue meth, you mean?
The teenth?

473
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:08,946
Yeah, well,
that teenth got things rolling.

474
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:12,449
I traced it to a gas station in Cibola.
That's where I got these.

475
00:42:12,658 --> 00:42:16,286
The station's closed-circuit was down...
Surprise, surprise.

476
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:21,375
- But I was able to pull some of these
snapshots off an ATM security camera.

477
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:24,044
We always thought these guys
might be camper-cooking.

478
00:42:24,253 --> 00:42:26,713
First off, your typical Class C
motor home...

479
00:42:26,922 --> 00:42:29,800
...is gonna grunt at least 5000 pounds
of interior fixtures.

480
00:42:30,008 --> 00:42:33,595
Appliances, furniture, built-ins,
5000 pounds at least, okay?

481
00:42:34,513 --> 00:42:36,390
See how high
that suspension's riding?

482
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:40,143
No way, no how, this thing's carrying
that kind of weight.

483
00:42:40,352 --> 00:42:44,147
This thing has been cleared out and
stripped down to its tight-and-curlies.

484
00:42:44,356 --> 00:42:47,693
For what? Blood bank?

485
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:49,987
Maybe a bookmobile?

486
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:53,991
There's no clear view of the plates.

487
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:56,451
Yeah, well, you can only get
so lucky, right?

488
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:00,289
But there's no front plate. Tells me
it's likely New Mexico registration.

489
00:43:00,497 --> 00:43:01,582
I check with DMV.

490
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:06,128
There are only 29 of these... early-'80s
Bounders registered in the state.

491
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:11,425
- Only 29?
- Yeah.

492
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:14,887
So I gotta go, you know,
knock on some doors.

493
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:24,396
They need you in El Paso, Hank.

494
00:43:24,646 --> 00:43:28,317
You bet. I'm just gonna wrap up
this Heisenberg thing first.

495
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:30,944
- You're refusing the assignment.
- I'm not. I'll go.

496
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:32,988
It's just I need some more time.

497
00:43:33,197 --> 00:43:35,991
You're not hearing me,
Agent Schrader.

498
00:43:36,325 --> 00:43:38,076
You're out of time.

499
00:43:38,911 --> 00:43:43,665
Are you going to El Paso now,
tonight?

500
00:43:47,669 --> 00:43:50,088
It's a simple yes or no.

501
00:43:56,762 --> 00:44:01,391
No. I can't.

502
00:44:04,102 --> 00:44:09,566
But that's only because
I'm really close to something big here.

503
00:44:19,868 --> 00:44:21,870
Better get to it, then.

504
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:50,274

Okay, okay.

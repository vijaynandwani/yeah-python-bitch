00:00:00,007 --> 00:00:03,025
<i>Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...</i>

2
00:00:04,152 --> 00:00:06,289
I think I may have another
job for your uncle.

3
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:07,574
<i>Jesse Pinkman.</i>

4
00:00:07,683 --> 00:00:11,562
<i>That barrel look familiar?
'Cause I just got six more exactly like.</i>

5
00:00:12,196 --> 00:00:15,123
I've got Jesse in sight, and
he's coming for me right now.

6
00:00:15,314 --> 00:00:16,719
- Where are you?
<i>- Get a pen.</i>

7
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:18,762
<i>Jack, don't come.</i>

8
00:00:18,912 --> 00:00:20,050
I've got him.

9
00:00:20,231 --> 00:00:22,498
<i>- Dead to rights.</i>
- You got Walt?

10
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:25,544
Police!
Drop your weapons!

11
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:27,360
Jack, don't do it!

12
00:00:46,853 --> 00:00:48,487
Mm-hmm.

13
00:00:48,522 --> 00:00:51,574
Yo, so what's next?

14
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:53,025
We wait.

15
00:00:53,076 --> 00:00:57,947
You don't got, like, eight more
anal things we gotta do first?

16
00:00:57,981 --> 00:00:59,448
The reaction has begun.

17
00:00:59,482 --> 00:01:02,001
Yeah, I-- I know.

18
00:01:02,035 --> 00:01:03,452
So how long?

19
00:01:03,486 --> 00:01:04,787
Well, if we had a freezer,

20
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:06,989
the condensed liquid
would cool more quickly,

21
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:08,507
because, of course,

22
00:01:08,542 --> 00:01:10,993
this is an exothermic reaction,

23
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:13,328
which means "giving off heat,"

24
00:01:13,346 --> 00:01:15,514
and our desired product is...

25
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:19,218
Put me into a coma,
why don't you?

26
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:21,470
What did you just say?

27
00:01:21,504 --> 00:01:25,140
What-- what? Nothing.

28
00:01:25,174 --> 00:01:27,476
Huh.

29
00:01:31,982 --> 00:01:35,017
No, no, no.
Not in here.

30
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:38,237
Duh.
Like I'm an idiot.

31
00:01:38,288 --> 00:01:41,490
Yeah.
Like you're an idiot.

32
00:01:41,524 --> 00:01:43,292
Dick.

33
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:55,888
Ah, God. Jesus.

34
00:01:55,922 --> 00:01:57,473
God.

35
00:01:57,507 --> 00:01:58,507
Shut up.

36
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,709
Oh, wow.

37
00:02:07,817 --> 00:02:10,069
Huh.

38
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:16,825
Bogdan-- Bogdan says I'm not
doing the receipts right.

39
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,578
Well, he's got a bug up his butt.

40
00:02:19,613 --> 00:02:22,031
He's-- he's got a stick
up his butt?

41
00:02:22,065 --> 00:02:25,117
He's got a bug up his butt
about the receipts, anyways.

42
00:02:25,168 --> 00:02:29,038
So anyway,
he's insisting that I--

43
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:33,258
He's demanding
that I stay and, uh,

44
00:02:33,293 --> 00:02:35,010
look over his system,

45
00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:37,262
and I cannot get out of it.

46
00:02:39,132 --> 00:02:40,132
Yeah.

47
00:02:50,777 --> 00:02:51,777
Hello.

48
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:53,261
<i>Hi, honey. It's me.</i>

49
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:54,780
Hey, you.
What's going on?

50
00:02:54,814 --> 00:02:56,031
<i>Nothing much.</i>

51
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:59,401
I-- I was--
I was just, um,

52
00:02:59,435 --> 00:03:02,121
calling to...
say I'm sorry,

53
00:03:02,155 --> 00:03:04,289
but I'm gonna be late tonight.

54
00:03:04,324 --> 00:03:07,076
Bogdan.
He's got a bug up his butt.

55
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,112
That's okay. I wasn't planning
anything special for dinner.

56
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,130
So...

57
00:03:11,164 --> 00:03:13,215
In fact,
you could take pity on us

58
00:03:13,249 --> 00:03:14,500
and bring a pizza home.

59
00:03:15,885 --> 00:03:17,920
They're having
a two-for-one at Venezia's,

60
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:20,639
and at this point I could
eat a whole one by myself.

61
00:03:20,674 --> 00:03:21,807
Yeah, yeah, sure.

62
00:03:21,841 --> 00:03:24,059
I can--
I can pick up a pizza.

63
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:26,762
Hopefully Bogdan
won't keep me too late.

64
00:03:26,796 --> 00:03:27,846
<i>He better not.</i>

65
00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:29,431
Trust me.
He does not want to piss off

66
00:03:29,465 --> 00:03:31,066
a hungry, pregnant woman.

67
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:32,651
Ooh.
What's that sound?

68
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:36,438
<i>I just sold</i>
<i>your favorite piece.</i>

69
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:38,640
The hideous crying clown.

70
00:03:38,658 --> 00:03:39,942
<i>Wow.</i>

71
00:03:39,976 --> 00:03:42,911
Yeah, and I got nine bucks
more than I paid for it.

72
00:03:42,946 --> 00:03:45,347
Shows what I know about art.

73
00:03:45,382 --> 00:03:46,815
<i>Hey, what do you think</i>
<i>about Holly?</i>

74
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,452
<i>For the baby's name.</i>

75
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:51,987
Do you like it?

76
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:54,023
I think I really like it.

77
00:03:54,057 --> 00:03:57,426
Holly. Yeah. It's nice.

78
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,094
Let me think about it.

79
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:00,879
Just feels right, you know?

80
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,514
It's my new favorite.

81
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:05,333
Well, it's a front-runner,
for sure.

82
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:07,169
Hiyah!

83
00:04:11,307 --> 00:04:13,341
Listen, I was thinking, um,

84
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:16,695
maybe we can have a little
family time this weekend?

85
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,147
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

86
00:04:18,181 --> 00:04:19,181
Yeah, you know.

87
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,866
Just take a drive.

88
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,485
The almost four of us.

89
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,654
Maybe we can head up
the Turquoise Trail,

90
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:28,657
stop at tinker town, maybe
grab some lunch in Madrid.

91
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:32,027
Oh, my God.
We haven't been there in forever.

92
00:04:32,045 --> 00:04:34,913
<i>I know.</i>
<i>So why don't we just do that?</i>

93
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:35,914
<i>Take a little break?</i>

94
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:38,667
<i>Sold. Sounds fun.</i>

95
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:42,054
Holly.
It's growing on me.

96
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:44,139
Yep. Me too.

97
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:46,725
All right,
well, I had better go

98
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,710
and get this in the mail.

99
00:04:48,728 --> 00:04:49,845
<i>Why don't you call me</i>

100
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,230
<i>when you're on</i>
<i>your way home, okay?</i>

101
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:52,765
Will do. Love you.

102
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:54,883
<i>Love you too.</i>

103

Ah.

105
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:37,211
Whoa.
Simmer down there, sparky.

106
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:45,386
What the hell
did we just walk into?

107
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,106
Hey, Uncle Jack,
I don't see Jesse Pinkman.

108
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,757
He was right here before.

109
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:52,593
- Anybody got eyes on Pinkman?
- No.

110
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:56,397
What do you figure?
He may be headed down that gully there?

111
00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:58,232
That's the way I'd go.

112
00:06:58,266 --> 00:07:01,285
Frankie, Lester, go find him.

113
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,071
Jack.

114
00:07:03,105 --> 00:07:05,656
These guys are DEA.

115
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:15,666
No! Jack, no!

116
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:17,251
Jack! Jack! Jack!

117
00:07:17,285 --> 00:07:19,253
No! No, don't!

118
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:21,339
Jack, don't. No.

119
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,509
No, Jack!
Jack, no!

120
00:07:26,428 --> 00:07:27,512
Jack, no.
Don't kill him.

121
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:28,763
Uh-uh, back it up.

122
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:30,264
Don't kill him.
Don't kill him, Jack.

123
00:07:30,298 --> 00:07:31,298
Get back here.

124
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:32,517
The hell not?
He's DEA.

125
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:35,853
No, he's--
he's family.

126
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:38,106
Say again?

127
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,074
He's my family.

128
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:42,410
He's my brother-in-law.

129
00:07:42,444 --> 00:07:44,412
Didn't cross your mind
to maybe tell us

130
00:07:44,446 --> 00:07:48,666
you had a DEA agent
for a brother-in-law?

131
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,700
Did you know about this?

132
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:51,953
I called you off, remember?

133
00:07:51,987 --> 00:07:53,538
I told you not to come.

134
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:55,206
Well, it seems to me
we did you a solid.

135
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:57,375
You weren't
supposed to be here.

136
00:07:57,426 --> 00:07:58,726
Too late now.

137
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:00,928
How's about you telling me
what was going down out here.

138
00:08:00,963 --> 00:08:03,698
Hmm? Yeah,
you and your brother-in-law

139
00:08:03,732 --> 00:08:06,267
don't seem to be
getting along too well.

140
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:08,186
It doesn't--
doesn't matter.

141
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,670
It doesn't concern you.

142
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:11,005
We just wasted
his partner here,

143
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,023
and he's wearing a bullet.

144
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:15,576
So, yeah,
I'd say it does concern me.

145
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:18,446
This is...
between him and me.

146
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,148
No cavalry comin'?

147
00:08:20,182 --> 00:08:21,783
No.

148
00:08:21,817 --> 00:08:23,401
You bet your ass
the cavalry's comin'.

149
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:24,452
No! No, no.

150
00:08:24,486 --> 00:08:26,320
Jack.

151
00:08:26,354 --> 00:08:29,740
Jack! No, the DEA
doesn't know about this.

152
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:33,244
Not yet.

153
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,799
Hank.

154
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:42,253
Nothing can change
what just happened,

155
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:45,173
but you can walk
out of here alive

156
00:08:45,207 --> 00:08:47,508
if you just promise us

157
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:51,596
that you'll--
you'll let this go.

158
00:08:53,215 --> 00:08:55,516
Yeah, I thought as much.

159
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,517
Sorry, man.

160
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:58,552
Just no scenario
where this guy lives.

161
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,104
No, no, no, listen!
I have money!

162
00:09:00,155 --> 00:09:04,325
I have money!
It's buried out here. It's...

163
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:09,230
It's $80 million.

164
00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:17,455
80 million.

165
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:26,047
So that's what got
this party started, huh?

166
00:09:26,081 --> 00:09:28,883
But this money of yours
won't do me much good in prison.

167
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:30,518
You can go anywhere.

168
00:09:30,552 --> 00:09:33,187
You can do anything.
Think about it.

169
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:38,109
You can have any future
that you want.

170
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:40,228
Jack.

171
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:43,614
80... million.

172
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:47,235
And all you've got to do

173
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:49,537
is let him go.

174
00:09:49,571 --> 00:09:51,272
That's a hell of an offer.

175
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,958
What do you think, Fed?

176
00:09:53,992 --> 00:09:55,710
Would you take that deal?

177
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:58,279
It's Hank.

178
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:03,084
His name is Hank.

179
00:10:03,118 --> 00:10:06,153
How about it, Hank?

180
00:10:06,154 --> 00:10:07,630
<i>Should I let you go?</i>

181
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:16,464
My name is ASAC Schrader.

182
00:10:16,498 --> 00:10:18,966
And you can go fuck yourself.

183
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:24,906
Hank... listen to me.

184
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,074
You gotta tell him.

185
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:29,277
You gotta tell him now
that we can work this out.

186
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:32,580
Please. Please.

187
00:10:32,614 --> 00:10:36,050
What?
You want me to beg?

188
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:41,655
You're the smartest guy
I ever met.

189
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:46,594
And you're too stupid to see...

190
00:10:46,628 --> 00:10:48,963
he made up his mind
ten minutes ago.

191
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:00,224
Do what you're gonna do.

192
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:40,014
Pretty specific directions.

193
00:11:40,048 --> 00:11:42,216
You know, most people
tell me to be somewhere,

194
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,434
they say, "West on the 40,

195
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:46,404
this or that exit,
second gas station on the left."

196
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:47,855
You know?

197
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:51,492
This here?
This is a whole other story.

198
00:11:51,526 --> 00:11:52,576
That fancy phone of yours,

199
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,862
where does it say
this is exactly?

200
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:01,369
Yeah...

201
00:12:05,907 --> 00:12:09,760
Look at this.
Even brought a shovel.

202
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,847
Jack.
No sign of Pinkman.

203
00:12:17,302 --> 00:12:19,220
All right.

204
00:12:19,254 --> 00:12:21,389
Says this is it right here.

205
00:12:21,423 --> 00:12:23,557
So dig.

206
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,135
What's that? A barrel?

207
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:53,971
Couple barrels?

208
00:12:58,626 --> 00:12:59,844
Jesus.

209
00:12:59,895 --> 00:13:00,895
Hell yeah!

210
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:02,346
Oh, Jesus.
Would you look at that?

211
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:05,483
Hell yeah!
Goddamn.

212
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:08,269
Whoo!

213
00:13:10,105 --> 00:13:13,157
What are you waiting for?

214
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:14,909
Yeah, boss.

215
00:13:14,943 --> 00:13:15,943
Hell yeah.

216
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:16,977
Let me get on this side.

217
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:17,995
Out of there, man.

218
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:20,664
Oh...

219
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:04,708
Okay.

220
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,328
Pull a barrel off the truck
and load it in the Chrysler.

221
00:14:07,362 --> 00:14:08,829
Seriously?

222
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:10,998
Jack.

223
00:14:11,032 --> 00:14:13,200
That's, like,
10 or 11 million right there.

224
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:14,718
You sure you wanna do that?

225
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,554
You gonna make me say it again?

226
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:19,056
Go. Go. Chop, chop.

227
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,758
Jesus. What's with
all the greed here?

228
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:23,761
It's unattractive.

229
00:14:27,015 --> 00:14:30,434
Hey.

230
00:14:30,485 --> 00:14:31,902
Hey.

231
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,104
I'm leaving you a barrel.

232
00:14:34,156 --> 00:14:37,775
Boys are gonna load it for you.

233
00:14:37,826 --> 00:14:40,027
You got the keys
for these cuffs?

234
00:14:51,206 --> 00:14:53,174
I'm sorry for your loss.

235
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,247
My nephew here,
he respects you.

236
00:15:00,265 --> 00:15:01,915
He would never forgive me

237
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:07,354
if things...
went another way.

238
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:08,439
Also, I'll be honest,

239
00:15:08,473 --> 00:15:09,890
you caught me
in one hell of a good mood.

240
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:11,258
So here's what's gonna happen.

241
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:12,476
You're gonna get in your car

242
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:15,112
and you're gonna
drive out of here.

243
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:17,147
All right?

244
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,234
No hard feelings.

245
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:23,270
Understand me?

246
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:26,373
We square?

247
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:28,375
Hey, man,
I gotta know we're square.

248
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,611
Or we're gonna have
to go that other way.

249
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:47,272
Pinkman.

250
00:15:49,814 --> 00:15:52,516
Pinkman.

251
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:55,315
You still owe me.

252
00:15:57,105 --> 00:15:59,440
If you can find him,
we'll kill him.

253
00:16:02,477 --> 00:16:04,811
Found him.

254
00:16:12,787 --> 00:16:15,422
No!

255
00:16:15,457 --> 00:16:18,125
Get off me!

256
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,710
Get off!

257
00:16:22,964 --> 00:16:24,798
No. No.

258
00:16:39,981 --> 00:16:41,949
Good to go?

259
00:16:47,855 --> 00:16:50,074
Hey, Uncle Jack.

260
00:16:56,665 --> 00:17:01,218
Well, he was out here
with those feds.

261
00:17:01,252 --> 00:17:02,419
Right?
Working with them.

262
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,537
Shouldn't we maybe find out

263
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,139
what he told them first?

264
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:08,225
'Cause, I mean, he had
to have told them some stuff

265
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:11,895
that might not
be too good for us.

266
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,066
And I'll bet we could
get it out of him back home.

267
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,219
I mean, I can do it.

268
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:23,023
Me and him, we got--
we got history.

269
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:26,727
And then, you know,

270
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:31,081
we'd take care
of the job after that.

271
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,117
Works for me.
Work for you?

272
00:17:39,073 --> 00:17:40,341
- Let's go.
- No.

273
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,042
No!

274
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:43,927
No!

275
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,095
No!

276
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,014
Wait.

277
00:17:57,192 --> 00:17:59,860
I watched Jane die.

278
00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:10,437
I was there.

279
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:13,774
And I watched her die.

280
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:20,297
I watched her overdose
and choke to death.

281
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:23,667
I could have saved her.

282
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:26,754
But I didn't.

283
00:22:58,261 --> 00:22:59,761
Hi.

284
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,565
Hello.

285
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,783
That truck belong to you?

286
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,605
It does.

287
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:12,608
I'd like to buy it.

288
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:14,776
It's not for sale.

289
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,386
Hey, Walt, it's me.

290
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,222
Um, just thought
I'd try you again.

291
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,608
We were just wondering
when you thought you'd be back,

292
00:23:46,643 --> 00:23:51,897
so, um, just give us a call
whenever you can.

293
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,900
Bye.

294
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,868
Hey, Aunt Marie.

295
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:59,871
Hey, sweetie.

296
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:01,490
I haven't seen you for a while.

297
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:02,708
What have you been up to?

298
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:05,043
Oh, you know.
This and that.

299
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:06,244
Your mom and I need to talk,

300
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,947
so... thought I'd stop by.

301
00:24:08,965 --> 00:24:12,117
Well, I, uh,
wish you'd called first.

302
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:14,720
This isn't the best time.

303
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:17,255
Well, Flynn looks like
he can hold down the fort.

304
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,290
Why don't we go
into your office?

305
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:27,516
I-- I got it.

306
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:30,519
Okay, honey.
Thanks.

307
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:46,484
Marie, I have nothing to say.

308
00:24:46,502 --> 00:24:47,669
Well, I do.

309
00:24:47,704 --> 00:24:50,923
So you can just
sit there and listen.

310
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:54,793
I got a call from Hank.

311
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,328
He arrested Walt
three hours ago.

312
00:24:57,347 --> 00:24:58,714
It's over.

313
00:24:58,765 --> 00:25:01,883
"Dead to rights"
I believe is the expression.

314
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:03,802
Hank and Steve Gomez

315
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,188
are working with
a former associate of Walt's,

316
00:25:06,222 --> 00:25:09,224
Jesse Pinkman,
whom I know you know,

317
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:10,859
and Pinkman has supplied them

318
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:14,196
with everything they need.

319
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:18,066
Hank is booking Walt
as we speak.

320
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:20,569
And I, for one,
could not be happier.

321
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:29,327
I almost didn't come here.

322
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:32,631
Christ, I barely
even know who you are,

323
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:33,765
and I sure as hell don't know

324
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,001
if I can ever trust you again.

325
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:46,211
And then I think about
how you are so upset with Walt

326
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:49,081
and how you wanted
the kids out of the house,

327
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:51,483
and all of this
makes me believe

328
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:53,952
that there has got
to be hope for you,

329
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:57,255
that whatever
he did to you can be undone.

330
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:06,431
All I know-- all I have been
forcing myself to remember,

331
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:08,166
is that you are my sister.

332
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:12,304
And so I'm here.

333
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:17,309
Marie.

334
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:18,343
Everything changes now.

335
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:21,680
And you have got
to prepare yourself.

336
00:26:21,714 --> 00:26:24,415
Hank will help you
as much as he can.

337
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:25,434
I know he will.

338
00:26:25,468 --> 00:26:29,971
And... I will support you
through this.

339
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:33,442
But I have conditions.

340
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:34,476
I want you to give me

341
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:35,894
every single copy
of that obscenity

342
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,596
that the two of you made
to discredit Hank.

343
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:43,101
That DVD.
Every single copy.

344
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:45,737
You understand me?

345
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,572
Answer me.
Do you understand me?

346
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:50,542
Yes.

347
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:54,446
Good.

348
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,082
Now dry your eyes
and get Flynn in here,

349
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,885
because you are going to tell him everything,
and I mean everything, Skyler.

350
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,155
He deserves to know
the truth from his family.

351
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:04,656
Not a bunch
of uniformed strangers.

352
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,476
No. No.
No, he cannot-- No.

353
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:11,129
You tell him. Or I will.

354
00:27:11,147 --> 00:27:13,265
There's no way around this.

355
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:16,935
He needs to know,
and he needs to know now.

356
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:53,138
No.

357
00:28:09,372 --> 00:28:12,624
Look, I gave you
what you wanted.

358
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:14,993
Come on.
Man, please.

359
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,461
Hey, please.

360
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:19,047
I told you where
to find the tape, okay?

361
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:21,416
Hey, just-- just-- just go.

362
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:22,751
Just-- just go there.

363
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:24,219
Just go to his house
and get it.

364
00:28:24,253 --> 00:28:25,253
We're on it.

365
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:27,756
Get it!

366
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:29,925
No one else knows about it.

367
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:31,760
Just me and his partner.

368
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:32,811
Okay.

369
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:35,013
No one else knows!
I swear!

370
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:29,828
Let's cook.

371
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:43,854
You're completely
out of your mind.

372
00:30:43,888 --> 00:30:45,422
It's the truth.

373
00:30:45,457 --> 00:30:46,507
It is, Flynn.

374
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:48,959
Then both of you
are out of your minds.

375
00:30:48,993 --> 00:30:50,661
You're full of shit,
is what you are.

376
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:51,679
Both of you.

377
00:30:51,713 --> 00:30:53,631
If-- if this is true,

378
00:30:53,665 --> 00:30:55,883
then how could you
keep this a secret?

379
00:30:55,934 --> 00:31:01,555
I mean, why?
Why would you go along?

380
00:31:01,606 --> 00:31:03,140
I'll be asking myself that

381
00:31:03,174 --> 00:31:04,858
for the rest of my life.

382
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:07,394
So you're saying
all of this time

383
00:31:07,445 --> 00:31:09,029
you were lying about this?

384
00:31:09,064 --> 00:31:11,014
I mean, so you're saying...

385
00:31:11,032 --> 00:31:12,316
you're a liar.

386
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,451
You-- you just admitted it.

387
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:18,288
So were you lying then,
or are you lying now?

388
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:20,040
Which lie is it?

389
00:31:20,075 --> 00:31:22,793
Flynn, honey, your mother
is telling you the truth.

390
00:31:22,827 --> 00:31:25,412
Right here, right now.
Believe it.

391
00:31:25,463 --> 00:31:26,863
You know what?

392
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:28,865
This-- this is bullshit.

393
00:31:28,883 --> 00:31:30,501
This is bullshit.

394
00:31:30,535 --> 00:31:31,969
I wanna talk to dad.

395
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:33,537
Your dad's in custody.

396
00:31:33,555 --> 00:31:35,639
You won't be able to talk to him
for a while, sweetie.

397
00:31:35,674 --> 00:31:36,757
I'm calling Uncle Hank.

398
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:38,142
I've tried.
He's not answering.

399
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:40,978
Probably because he is in the
thick of it with your father.

400
00:31:41,012 --> 00:31:44,014
Honey, I know this is a lot
to process, Flynn,

401
00:31:44,048 --> 00:31:45,099
but if you could just breathe.

402
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,934
Just try to breathe,
and just trust--

403
00:31:46,985 --> 00:31:49,820
Really? Really?
Try to breathe?

404
00:31:52,724 --> 00:31:53,724
Oh, my God.

405
00:31:58,462 --> 00:31:59,595
Go home.

406
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:03,047
Just take the kids home, okay?
Go home and regroup.

407
00:32:03,082 --> 00:32:04,403
I'll stop by later.

408
00:32:37,668 --> 00:32:41,004
Flynn?

409
00:32:41,022 --> 00:32:43,807
Could you put
your seatbelt on please?

410
00:32:47,061 --> 00:32:50,363
Please.
It's not safe.

411
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:52,649
You're shittin' me, right?

412
00:32:56,988 --> 00:33:00,991
If all this is true
and you knew about it,

413
00:33:01,025 --> 00:33:04,127
then-- then you're
as bad as him.

414
00:33:14,472 --> 00:33:16,890
Whose truck is that?

415
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:25,649
Dad?

416
00:33:25,683 --> 00:33:27,017
Listen.

417
00:33:27,051 --> 00:33:30,353
I need you to come inside
and pack right now.

418
00:33:30,387 --> 00:33:33,440
Mom, Aunt Marie, they said
that you were arrested?

419
00:33:33,491 --> 00:33:34,774
No, just--

420
00:33:34,825 --> 00:33:37,027
They say that you're
some kind of drug dealer?

421
00:33:37,061 --> 00:33:38,445
No, just come inside,
please. Now.

422
00:33:38,496 --> 00:33:39,663
Come inside. Come on.

423
00:33:39,697 --> 00:33:41,698
Go, go, go, go.

424
00:33:41,732 --> 00:33:44,251
Dad, stop.
Just talk to me please.

425
00:33:44,285 --> 00:33:45,619
Our priority
right now is to pack.

426
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,570
Uncle Hank,
they said he arrested you?

427
00:33:47,588 --> 00:33:50,240
I will discuss
all of this later, okay?

428
00:33:50,258 --> 00:33:51,291
Just tell me what--

429
00:33:51,342 --> 00:33:52,759
Just listen to me!

430
00:33:52,793 --> 00:33:54,511
I need you to go
into your bedroom right now

431
00:33:54,545 --> 00:33:55,962
and grab anything
that's important.

432
00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:57,214
You understand?
Go. Now.

433
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,882
Both of you.
Go.

434
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:02,585
Walt.

435
00:34:02,603 --> 00:34:04,271
Why are you here?

436
00:34:04,305 --> 00:34:06,756
Skyler, please,
will you just go get your things?

437
00:34:06,774 --> 00:34:08,358
For you and the kids.
Right now.

438
00:34:08,392 --> 00:34:09,592
This is our priority.

439
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,061
Hank had you in custody.

440
00:34:11,095 --> 00:34:13,697
- He wouldn't just let you go.
- I--

441
00:34:13,731 --> 00:34:14,698
Where is he?

442
00:34:14,732 --> 00:34:15,899
- I--
- Where's Hank?

443
00:34:15,933 --> 00:34:17,867
I...

444
00:34:17,902 --> 00:34:19,486
I negotiated...

445
00:34:19,537 --> 00:34:20,537
Negotiated?

446
00:34:20,571 --> 00:34:21,571
Uh, yes.

447
00:34:21,605 --> 00:34:25,242
What does that mean?

448
00:34:25,276 --> 00:34:26,960
It means...

449
00:34:26,994 --> 00:34:28,662
we're fine, okay?

450
00:34:28,713 --> 00:34:30,280
We are. We're fine.

451
00:34:30,298 --> 00:34:31,965
Everything is gonna be fine,

452
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:33,667
but we need to leave right now.

453
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:34,918
All right?
Can we do that?

454
00:34:34,952 --> 00:34:36,469
What happened?

455
00:34:36,504 --> 00:34:38,505
Where is Hank?

456
00:34:38,556 --> 00:34:40,173
Why do we need to leave?

457
00:34:40,224 --> 00:34:43,843
I need both of you to trust me.

458
00:34:43,894 --> 00:34:45,929
Right now, okay?

459
00:34:45,963 --> 00:34:48,131
Please just work with me here

460
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:51,935
and I promise I will explain
everything later, okay?

461
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:55,855
Where... is... hank?

462
00:35:00,278 --> 00:35:01,854
Skyler.

463
00:35:04,865 --> 00:35:09,703
I have $11 million in cash

464
00:35:09,754 --> 00:35:12,088
right outside.

465
00:35:12,123 --> 00:35:15,091
We can have a fresh start.

466
00:35:15,126 --> 00:35:18,461
Whole new lives.

467
00:35:18,495 --> 00:35:21,514
All we have to do is go.

468
00:35:21,549 --> 00:35:24,384
We have to go right now.

469
00:35:24,435 --> 00:35:27,053
That's all we have to do.

470
00:35:30,174 --> 00:35:33,026
You killed him.

471
00:35:36,814 --> 00:35:39,282
You killed Hank.

472
00:35:39,317 --> 00:35:40,450
What?

473
00:35:40,484 --> 00:35:41,484
No. No. No.

474
00:35:41,518 --> 00:35:42,485
You killed him.

475
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:43,787
No, no. No!

476
00:35:43,821 --> 00:35:45,789
I tried to save him.

477
00:35:45,823 --> 00:35:48,158
Uncle Hank
is dead? I--

478
00:35:48,192 --> 00:35:49,626
Mom, it can't be true.

479
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,294
- Just stop, please.
- It just can't be true.

480
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:53,997
Everything-- everything
is gonna be okay.

481
00:35:54,031 --> 00:35:55,715
Everything's gonna be fine.
I promise you.

482
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,384
But we need to leave right now.

483
00:35:57,418 --> 00:36:00,470
Dad, what's going on?
Talk to me.

484
00:36:00,504 --> 00:36:03,340
Just stop for one second.

485
00:36:03,374 --> 00:36:05,141
Look, I told you
to get your things.

486
00:36:05,176 --> 00:36:06,426
Stop walking away.

487
00:36:06,477 --> 00:36:07,477
There is no time

488
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:08,978
tell me about Uncle Hank.

489
00:36:09,013 --> 00:36:10,013
No, just drop it!

490
00:36:10,047 --> 00:36:11,547
But-- what's wrong
with you?

491
00:36:11,565 --> 00:36:13,900
We're going.
We're going right now.

492
00:36:13,934 --> 00:36:15,352
You have to tell me.
Dad, wait.

493
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:16,986
What happened to Uncle Hank?
What--

494
00:36:23,411 --> 00:36:25,895
Get out.

495
00:36:25,913 --> 00:36:28,865
Skyler, I promise you,
we will figure this out.

496
00:36:28,899 --> 00:36:29,899
Enough.

497
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:32,802
Mom, what are you doing?

498
00:36:32,837 --> 00:36:35,038
Skyler,
put the knife down please.

499
00:36:35,072 --> 00:36:36,239
I promise you,
everything--

500
00:36:36,257 --> 00:36:40,927
Don't say one more word.

501
00:36:40,961 --> 00:36:45,348
Get out of here.
Now.

502
00:36:45,383 --> 00:36:46,633
Skyler.

503
00:36:46,684 --> 00:36:47,634
Get out.

504
00:36:47,685 --> 00:36:49,636
Aah!

505
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:57,444
Stop it. Just stop!

506
00:36:57,478 --> 00:36:58,862
Stop please.
Stop.

507
00:36:58,896 --> 00:37:01,281
Get away from us!

508
00:37:01,315 --> 00:37:04,150
Just stop! Stop!

509
00:37:04,201 --> 00:37:06,569
Just stop it!

510
00:37:06,603 --> 00:37:08,705
Mom, stop it.

511
00:37:08,739 --> 00:37:09,873
Stop, dad.

512
00:37:09,907 --> 00:37:12,041
Stop it now. Stop.

513
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:14,627
Just please stop!

514
00:37:14,662 --> 00:37:16,913
Stop it! Stop!

515
00:37:16,947 --> 00:37:18,781
Stop it.
Aah!

516
00:37:24,171 --> 00:37:25,638
What the hell
is wrong with you!

517
00:37:25,673 --> 00:37:27,807
We're a family!

518
00:37:33,431 --> 00:37:34,964
We're a family.

519
00:37:39,186 --> 00:37:41,271
What are you doing?

520
00:37:41,305 --> 00:37:42,305
What are you doing?

521
00:37:42,323 --> 00:37:44,274
Yeah,
I-- I need the police.

522
00:37:44,308 --> 00:37:47,193
My dad, he pulled
a knife on my mom.

523
00:37:47,244 --> 00:37:49,829
He attacked her.
He's dangerous.

524
00:37:49,864 --> 00:37:53,333
I-- I think he might
have killed somebody.

525
00:37:53,334 --> 00:37:55,037
Yeah.

526
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,538
He's still--
he's still here.

527
00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:02,959
Yeah, he's--
he's still in the house.

528
00:38:02,993 --> 00:38:06,296
We're at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.

529
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:09,499
308 Negra Arroyo Lane!
You've gotta come quick.

530
00:38:09,517 --> 00:38:11,634
Hurry.
Oh, God, no!

531
00:38:13,971 --> 00:38:15,688
Oh, my God. No.

532
00:38:15,723 --> 00:38:17,724
Walt, no!

533
00:38:17,775 --> 00:38:20,310
Walt! Walt! Please, no!

534
00:38:20,344 --> 00:38:23,679
No! No! No!

535
00:38:23,697 --> 00:38:25,648
Walt, no! Let her go!

536
00:38:25,682 --> 00:38:27,484
You can't take her!

537
00:38:27,518 --> 00:38:28,735
Let her go, please!

538
00:38:28,786 --> 00:38:30,537
You can't take her!

539
00:38:30,571 --> 00:38:32,822
Let her go!

540
00:38:32,856 --> 00:38:34,190
Walt!

541
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:36,326
Please, no!

542
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,879
Walt, no!
Walt, please!

543
00:38:39,914 --> 00:38:41,798
Walt! No!

544
00:38:41,832 --> 00:38:44,867
Walt, please, no!

545
00:38:44,885 --> 00:38:48,838
Walt! Please! Please, stop!

546
00:38:48,872 --> 00:38:52,008
Walt!

547
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:04,902
Say "da-da."

548
00:39:04,936 --> 00:39:08,005
Da-da.
You say "da-da"?

549
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:09,089
There.

550
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,059
Get rid of that
stinky old diaper, huh?

551
00:39:12,093 --> 00:39:13,477
Don't be sad.

552
00:39:13,512 --> 00:39:15,145
Where's your belly button?

553
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,348
Where's your belly button?

554
00:39:17,382 --> 00:39:18,382
There.

555
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,150
Now don't you feel better?

556
00:39:20,185 --> 00:39:22,069
You're all nice and dry.

557
00:39:22,103 --> 00:39:24,605
Huh? That feels good?

558
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:27,157
Oh, I know.
You were so wet and so cranky,

559
00:39:27,192 --> 00:39:29,109
but now you feel better,
don't you?

560
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,578
Next order of business

561
00:39:30,612 --> 00:39:33,664
is to get you
a brand-new car seat.

562
00:39:33,698 --> 00:39:36,700
Won't that be nice, Holly?

563
00:39:36,734 --> 00:39:40,087
Mamama.

564
00:39:40,121 --> 00:39:41,956
Mama-- ma.

565
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:44,792
Mama.

566
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:48,012
Mama.

567
00:39:48,046 --> 00:39:50,286
Mamama.

568
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,105
Mamama.

569
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:00,724
Mamama.

570
00:40:04,613 --> 00:40:06,864
Mama.

571
00:40:17,409 --> 00:40:19,209
Confirming the abduction.

572
00:40:19,244 --> 00:40:21,962
Amber Alert.
Holly White.

573
00:40:21,997 --> 00:40:24,131
Female. 18 months.

574
00:40:24,165 --> 00:40:26,300
Blond hair, blue eyes.

575
00:40:26,334 --> 00:40:31,639
Last seen wearing
a pink and white jacket...

576
00:40:31,673 --> 00:40:33,507
abductor is the father...

577
00:40:33,558 --> 00:40:35,142
He was in handcuffs.

578
00:40:35,176 --> 00:40:38,095
Hank had him in handcuffs.

579
00:40:41,182 --> 00:40:42,816
Gold, wire-framed glasses.

580
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:46,904
Are you expecting a call?

581
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,443
<i>Hi, you've reached the White family.</i>

582
00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:52,976
<i>Please, leave a message.</i>

583
00:40:52,994 --> 00:40:54,244
<i>Skyler, it's me.</i>

584
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:55,362
<i>Pick up. Pick up.</i>

585
00:40:55,413 --> 00:40:58,248
That's him.
That's my husband.

586
00:40:58,283 --> 00:40:59,483
<i>I need you</i>
<i>to pick up the phone.</i>

587
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:00,668
- Start tracing the landline.
<i>- Skyler...</i>

588
00:41:00,702 --> 00:41:06,540
- The number's 505-177-8987.
<i>- I know you're there, so pick it up.</i>

589
00:41:06,591 --> 00:41:08,459
<i>Skyler?</i>

590
00:41:08,493 --> 00:41:10,377
- Need the location of an incoming caller.
<i>- You hear me?</i>

591
00:41:10,428 --> 00:41:11,865
<i>Answer the pho--</i>

592
00:41:15,684 --> 00:41:18,435
Walt. Where's Holly?

593
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,970
<i>Are you alone?</i>

594
00:41:20,004 --> 00:41:23,140
<i>No police?</i>

595
00:41:23,174 --> 00:41:24,608
No.

596
00:41:24,643 --> 00:41:25,859
No police.

597
00:41:25,894 --> 00:41:27,511
Where are you?

598
00:41:27,529 --> 00:41:32,032
Where's Holly?

599
00:41:32,067 --> 00:41:33,183
Walt!

600
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:35,319
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>is wrong with you?</i>

601
00:41:35,353 --> 00:41:39,957
<i>Why can't you do</i>
<i>one thing I say?</i>

602
00:41:39,991 --> 00:41:40,991
What?

603
00:41:41,025 --> 00:41:42,209
<i>This is your fault.</i>

604
00:41:42,243 --> 00:41:45,162
<i>This is what comes</i>
<i>of your disrespect.</i>

605
00:41:45,196 --> 00:41:47,081
I told you, Skyler.

606
00:41:47,132 --> 00:41:49,049
I warned you for a solid year.

607
00:41:49,084 --> 00:41:51,885
You cross me,
there will be consequences.

608
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,804
What part of that
didn't you understand?

609
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:56,924
You took my child.

610
00:41:56,975 --> 00:41:58,559
'Cause you need to learn.

611
00:41:58,593 --> 00:42:00,477
You bring her back.

612
00:42:00,512 --> 00:42:01,979
Maybe now you'll listen.

613
00:42:02,013 --> 00:42:04,848
Maybe now you'll use
your damn head.

614
00:42:04,882 --> 00:42:07,234
You know,
you never believed in me.

615
00:42:07,268 --> 00:42:10,654
You were never grateful
for anything I did for this family.

616
00:42:10,689 --> 00:42:14,575
<i>"Oh, no. Walt.</i>
<i>Walt, you have to stop.</i>

617
00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:18,729
<i>You have to stop this.</i>
<i>It's immoral. It's illegal.</i>

618
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:20,614
<i>Someone might get hurt."</i>

619
00:42:20,665 --> 00:42:23,701
<i>You're always whining</i>
<i>and complaining</i>

620
00:42:23,735 --> 00:42:25,169
<i>about how I make my money,</i>

621
00:42:25,203 --> 00:42:26,954
<i>just dragging me down.</i>

622
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:31,041
<i>While I do everything.</i>

623
00:42:31,075 --> 00:42:32,843
<i>And now--</i>

624
00:42:32,877 --> 00:42:37,181
now you tell my son what I do

625
00:42:37,215 --> 00:42:40,584
<i>after I've told you</i>
<i>and told you</i>

626
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:44,104
<i>to keep your damn mouth shut.</i>

627
00:42:44,139 --> 00:42:49,943
You stupid bitch.

628
00:42:49,978 --> 00:42:52,479
<i>How dare you?</i>

629
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:06,410
I'm sorry.

630
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:14,301
You, you have no right

631
00:43:14,335 --> 00:43:18,422
to discuss anything
about what I do.

632
00:43:18,456 --> 00:43:20,758
Oh, what-- what the hell
do you know about it anyway?

633
00:43:20,792 --> 00:43:23,310
<i>Nothing. I built this.</i>

634
00:43:23,344 --> 00:43:25,479
<i>Me. Me alone.</i>
<i>Nobody else!</i>

635
00:43:25,513 --> 00:43:28,965
You're right.

636
00:43:28,983 --> 00:43:30,934
You're right.

637
00:43:30,969 --> 00:43:36,640
You mark my words, Skyler.

638
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:38,609
Tow the line,

639
00:43:38,643 --> 00:43:42,579
or you will wind up
just like Hank.

640
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:48,001
Walt.

641
00:43:48,036 --> 00:43:51,588
Tell me what happened.

642
00:43:51,623 --> 00:43:54,258
Where is Hank?

643
00:43:54,292 --> 00:43:56,460
Please.

644
00:43:56,494 --> 00:43:58,045
We need to know.

645
00:44:03,968 --> 00:44:06,770
You're never gonna
see Hank again.

646
00:44:12,176 --> 00:44:16,280
<i>He crossed me.</i>

647
00:44:16,314 --> 00:44:19,700
<i>You think about that.</i>

648
00:44:19,734 --> 00:44:23,787
<i>Family or no.</i>

649
00:44:23,822 --> 00:44:26,287
You let that sink in.

650
00:44:28,376 --> 00:44:31,361
<i>Walt.</i>

651
00:44:31,379 --> 00:44:36,700
<i>I just want Holly back.</i>

652
00:44:36,718 --> 00:44:39,480
<i>Please, Walt.</i>

653
00:44:42,206 --> 00:44:44,892
<i>Just come home.</i>

654
00:44:51,566 --> 00:44:55,102
I've still got things
left to do.

655
00:45:27,466 --> 00:45:29,003
_

656
00:45:39,063 --> 00:45:41,064
Hey.

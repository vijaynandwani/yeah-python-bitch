1
00:00:03,894 --> 00:00:07,368
In closing, I can tell you
we take this very seriously.

2
00:00:07,485 --> 00:00:10,059
APD as well as the DEA.

3
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,724
Stopping the manufacture
and sale of methamphetamines

4
00:00:12,725 --> 00:00:14,655
remains one of
our highest priorities.

5
00:00:14,662 --> 00:00:17,649
And the theft of lab equipment
from your school is also receiving

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,038
our highest attention.

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,956
Rest assured, no stone
will go unturned

8
00:00:21,979 --> 00:00:25,165
in our search for the person or persons
responsible for this.

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,732
If you have any questions,
now would be the time.

10
00:00:27,898 --> 00:00:31,320
You're talking like you haven't
caught anybody yet.

11
00:00:31,373 --> 00:00:33,966
What about the janitor
that was dealing drugs at the school?

12
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:37,782
There is no indication that
this individual was selling drugs.

13
00:00:37,854 --> 00:00:41,728
He was arrested for having
a small amount of marijuana in his car,

14
00:00:41,748 --> 00:00:43,330
not in the school.

15
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:45,274
And he's
since been fired.

16
00:00:45,286 --> 00:00:46,984
I heard he had a record.

17
00:00:47,025 --> 00:00:49,446
I'd like to know how he got
a job here in the first place.

18
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:52,603
- Why wasn't there a background check?
- There was one.

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,878
We're currently reviewing
our hiring policies.

20
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,509
You better be doing more than that.
He was arrested in front of my daughter.

21
00:00:59,534 --> 00:01:01,758
This guy was stealing
the lab equipment, right?

22
00:01:01,777 --> 00:01:03,809
That's not our thinking
at this time.

23
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:07,511
We are looking at others who had access,
not limited to the maintenance staff.

24
00:01:07,518 --> 00:01:10,997
Are you saying there was a break-in?
Do we know exactly when this happened?

25
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:13,268
I mean, could it have been
during school hours?

26
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:15,527
We haven't been able
to establish a date or time,

27
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,262
but there is no sign
of breaking or entering.

28
00:01:18,332 --> 00:01:20,498
Whoever took it had a key?

29
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:24,676
We're talking inside job?
Someone who's still at the school?

30
00:01:24,702 --> 00:01:28,667
At this time I'm not able to discuss
the details, but what I can tell you

31
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:31,793
is that we have some very good people
working very hard on this case.

32
00:01:31,811 --> 00:01:34,484
I'm sorry, Officer.
But that sounds like double-talk.

33
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:37,523
We're trying to protect our children.
You have to level with us.

34
00:01:37,543 --> 00:01:40,603
Really, we are giving you
all the information we have.

35
00:01:40,628 --> 00:01:44,140
You know what I'd like to see
in this school? Drug-sniffing dogs.

36
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:46,475
Yeah, dogs,
and metal detectors,

37
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,439
and locker searches,
and strip searches.

38
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:51,870
- Our district has strict policies...
- I heard about this school in Canada.

39
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:54,731
They arrested one of their
groundskeepers with drugs.

40
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:58,496
And the next day they found out over
half of the students were high on LSD.

41
00:01:58,506 --> 00:02:01,427
LSD? When were you gonna
tell us about the LSD?

42
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:04,929
No. Please.
No one said anything about LSD.

43
00:02:09,186 --> 00:02:11,370
What about the equipment
that was stolen?

44
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:14,716
The equipment was taken
from our chemistry department.

45
00:02:15,294 --> 00:02:19,290
And I would like someone
to give us some specifics.

46
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:20,794
Walt?

47
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:24,050
Yeah.

48
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:28,286
Mr. White is currently
on medical leave.

49
00:02:28,744 --> 00:02:31,129
But as he's chair
of the science department,

50
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:34,402
he's made a very special
effort to be with us here.

51
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:38,397
And I'd like to take
a moment to thank him for that.

52
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,119
Could you please tell us more
about the equipment that was taken?

53
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:52,290
- Please.
- Yes.

54
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:57,614
And thank you.

55
00:03:02,237 --> 00:03:05,465
The inventory list for
the missing labware is as follows:

56
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:08,466
one 5,000 milliliter

57
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:10,931
round bottom boiling flask,

58
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,883
one Kjeldahl-style recovery flask,
800 milliliters,

59
00:03:15,744 --> 00:03:17,889
two full-face respirators,

60
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,549
some sep funnels,

61
00:03:20,564 --> 00:03:23,102
a sill head with
a thermometer holder...

62
00:03:29,971 --> 00:03:31,460
Ow, my knee.

63
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:37,955
Where... did that come from?

64
00:03:38,628 --> 00:03:41,127
And why was it
so damn good?

65
00:03:42,962 --> 00:03:45,102
Because it was illegal.

66
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:49,876
"A No-Rough-Stuff-Type Deal"

67
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:03,221
www.forom.com
www.sub-way.fr

68
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:25,195
The basement.

69
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:26,751
Unfinished, of course.

70
00:04:26,754 --> 00:04:28,710
But just look
at all this space.

71
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:32,068
You gotta think
rec room, media room.

72
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,908
Just imagine all the things
you could do down here.

73
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:38,926
Now remember, you're buying
for this fantastic neigorhood.

74
00:04:38,953 --> 00:04:41,317
Big lawns
and shade tress.

75
00:04:41,325 --> 00:04:43,735
Walking distance
to the country club.

76
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:52,041
What happened there?

77
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:56,755
Bit of a fixer, but this house
has great bones.

78
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:04,364
You know what? We're zeroing in.
I've got another listing,

79
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:06,556
brand-new, right around the corner.

80
00:05:07,414 --> 00:05:08,247
Hi.

81
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:09,462
Hi.

82
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,241
It's by appointment only.

83
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:14,460
I'm here to see the owner.

84
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,508
He's in the...

85
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,818
recreational vehicle.

86
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,154
Yo, it's appointment only!

87
00:05:41,313 --> 00:05:42,907
How you feeling?

88
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,762
About as good
as you look.

89
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:51,498
Jeez, you look like... Lex Luthor.

90
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:55,784
Listen, I visited you in the hospital,
but you were asleep.

91
00:05:55,873 --> 00:05:59,052
Yeah, Skinny Pete said
you wanted Tuco's address.

92
00:05:59,128 --> 00:06:02,124
Acting like you were
all out for blood.

93
00:06:02,225 --> 00:06:06,011
You are alive,
so obviously you wised up.

94
00:06:06,136 --> 00:06:08,786
- No, I did go see him.
- Bullshit.

95
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:10,576
Are you selling your house?

96
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:12,484
I got two dudes
that turned into

97
00:06:12,486 --> 00:06:15,242
raspberry slushie and
flushed down my toilet.

98
00:06:15,336 --> 00:06:17,787
I can't even take
a proper dump in there.

99
00:06:17,862 --> 00:06:21,055
The whole damn house
has got to be haunted by now.

100
00:06:22,084 --> 00:06:24,709
You didn't actually
go see Tuco?

101
00:06:25,947 --> 00:06:26,755
Here.

102
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:32,567
That is seventeen-five.

103
00:06:32,617 --> 00:06:34,779
Your half of the 35,000.

104
00:06:34,855 --> 00:06:38,053
Plus there's an extra 15 in there.
It's all yours.

105
00:06:38,146 --> 00:06:39,614
You've earned it.

106
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:41,329
You got this money
from Tuco.

107
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:42,174
Yeah.

108
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,918
So Tuco gave you this
is what you're saying.

109
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:48,135
- We made a deal.
- You made a deal?

110
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:49,918
- That's right.
- Wait.

111
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:53,183
Why would you make
a deal with that scumbag?

112
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:54,759
You see what he did to me?

113
00:06:54,765 --> 00:06:57,408
Because I think that
we can do business together.

114
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,605
We came to
an understanding.

115
00:06:59,637 --> 00:07:02,034
No way, man! Okay?
No understanding.

116
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:04,166
Take a look at
the money in your hand.

117
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:07,580
Now just imagine
making that every week.

118
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,314
That's right.

119
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,684
Two pounds a week.
35,000 a pound.

120
00:07:12,692 --> 00:07:15,527
Without even talking to me,
you told...

121
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:18,699
this insane ass clown

122
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,359
dead-eyed killer that, uh...

123
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:24,944
that we would give him
two pounds a week?

124
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:26,645
We'll just scale up
our operation.

125
00:07:26,651 --> 00:07:29,306
- We'll add a few more hours...
- Don't talk to me about hours.

126
00:07:29,308 --> 00:07:32,829
What about pseudo, man?
How are we gonna get that?

127
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:36,481
You think the meth fairy
is just gonna bring it to us?

128
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:39,563
It takes me a week
to get this stuff.

129
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:42,052
I'm driving all the way
out to Las Cruces.

130
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:44,862
200 miles each way
to meet up with my smurfs...

131
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:48,322
- Smurfs?
- Dudes who go to the drugstores

132
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:51,188
and get a couple boxes
at a time and then sell them to me.

133
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:54,561
And that's maybe only good for,
like, maybe a half-pound worth.

134
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,681
See, that's the bottleneck
in your brilliant business plan.

135
00:07:58,695 --> 00:07:59,522
All right.

136
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:03,282
Of course you would have known that
if you would have just asked me.

137
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:06,845
Well, here we are again.

138
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:08,583
Here we are.

139
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:10,712
- Skyler, you look great.
- Thank you.

140
00:08:10,728 --> 00:08:13,246
You must be, what,
six, seven months?

141
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:14,977
How goes it?

142
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,340
It's great...

143
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,229
other than waddling to the bathroom
every five minutes.

144
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:24,333
The baby shower's next week.
It'll be good to...

145
00:08:25,368 --> 00:08:27,336
It'll be good
to have a day that's...

146
00:08:27,386 --> 00:08:29,128
just about Skyler.

147
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,298
Very nice.

148
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,216
Thank you.

149
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:35,985
Well, Walt, I see you've
committed to the hair loss.

150
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:36,980
Yeah.

151
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:40,033
- How do you feel?
- Oh, okay.

152
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,544
You know,
pretty decent actually.

153
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:46,797
His color is better.
You know, his energy.

154
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,614
And he's even more...

155
00:08:50,715 --> 00:08:51,823
physical.

156
00:08:51,838 --> 00:08:53,276
More physical?

157
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:55,566
Well... sexual.

158
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,467
Frisky, actually.

159
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:03,176
I mean, that's got
to be a good sign, right?

160
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,693
Sure, I'll take that.

161
00:09:04,707 --> 00:09:05,994
Right, Walt?

162
00:09:06,352 --> 00:09:09,094
Couldn't that mean that
the chemo is working?

163
00:09:09,202 --> 00:09:13,150
Realistically, it may just mean that
we've got the anti-emetics tuned right.

164
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:16,547
Truth is, until Walt's finished
this round of chemo

165
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,859
and we look at a new PET scan,
we just can't say for sure.

166
00:09:19,938 --> 00:09:22,222
Isn't there anything else
we could be doing?

167
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:24,472
I've been wondering about...

168
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:25,969
alternative medicine.

169
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:28,177
I mean, Eastern healing.

170
00:09:29,563 --> 00:09:31,519
You know, holistic.

171
00:09:31,608 --> 00:09:34,052
Well, I can't speak
to its efficacy.

172
00:09:34,132 --> 00:09:37,231
But as long as it doesn't
interfere with our treatment,

173
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:40,082
anything that helps my patient
have a better outlook,

174
00:09:40,086 --> 00:09:43,014
a better comfort,
is fine by me.

175
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:47,497
So you're saying
it's all psychological.

176
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,057
It doesn't make
any real difference.

177
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,615
Having a better outlook
can make a tremendous difference.

178
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,482
But it's also important
that we manage our expectations.

179
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:20,020
What?

180
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,503
A junkyard?

181
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,801
Let me guess,
you picked this place?

182
00:10:30,788 --> 00:10:33,413
What's wrong with it?
It's private.

183
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:38,353
This is like... a non-criminal's
idea of a drug meet.

184
00:10:38,627 --> 00:10:42,276
This is like, "Oh, I saw this
in a movie. Oh, look at me."

185
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,420
So where do you transact
your business? Enlighten me.

186
00:10:45,446 --> 00:10:48,220
I don't know.
How about Taco Cabeza?

187
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:51,427
Half the deals I've ever done
went down at Taco Cabeza.

188
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,157
Nice and public.

189
00:10:53,623 --> 00:10:55,452
Open 24 hours.

190
00:10:56,134 --> 00:10:58,891
Nobody ever gets shot
at Taco Cabeza.

191
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,029
Hell, why not the mall?

192
00:11:03,027 --> 00:11:06,434
You know, wait at the Gap.
"Hey! It's time for the meet."

193
00:11:06,587 --> 00:11:09,375
You know, I'll put down
the flat-front khakis,

194
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:11,854
head on over,
grab an Orange Julius.

195
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:15,334
Skip the part
where psycho lunatic Tuco

196
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:19,127
comes and steals my drugs
and leaves me bleeding to death.

197
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:31,301
Look, you don't have
to be here for this.

198
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,572
Okay?
I mean, seriously.

199
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:34,941
I'm okay.

200
00:11:37,853 --> 00:11:39,669
Nah, I'm no pussy.

201
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,474
I'm good.

202
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:02,287
Mr. Clean and his boy.

203
00:12:04,381 --> 00:12:06,438
I'm sorry that I had
to tune you up.

204
00:12:06,451 --> 00:12:09,441
Respect, ese.
You gotta give it to get it.

205
00:12:13,473 --> 00:12:16,080
Hey, what are we doing
way the hell out here?

206
00:12:16,123 --> 00:12:18,798
What, they close
the mall or something?

207
00:12:20,618 --> 00:12:22,978
Heisenberg, come on,
break it out.

208
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:28,545
That's it?
That's all you got?

209
00:12:28,646 --> 00:12:30,930
We had some
production problems.

210
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,257
Point five-three.

211
00:12:34,414 --> 00:12:36,433
I thought you was
a player.

212
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:38,787
You told me two pounds,

213
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:41,930
and now you waste my time
with these Chiclets?

214
00:12:52,997 --> 00:12:54,587
17½...

215
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,019
minus the half
for wasting my time.

216
00:12:58,049 --> 00:12:59,027
Hey, come on.

217
00:12:59,037 --> 00:13:02,187
What, you're gonna argue?
You got something to say?

218
00:13:05,564 --> 00:13:08,655
You're doing business
like a couple little bitches.

219
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:10,889
I want all of it.

220
00:13:14,435 --> 00:13:15,772
70 grand.

221
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:17,359
What did you say?

222
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,485
You like this product,
and you want more.

223
00:13:21,183 --> 00:13:23,580
Consider it
a capital investment.

224
00:13:26,488 --> 00:13:28,987
Loco bald motherfucker.

225
00:13:33,232 --> 00:13:35,917
52½.
25 points vig.

226
00:13:36,658 --> 00:13:37,604
Vig?

227
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:41,753
Interest. Weekly.

228
00:13:44,186 --> 00:13:45,145
Okay.

229
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:47,517
That's...

230
00:13:48,488 --> 00:13:52,299
$65,625 with interest.

231
00:13:52,716 --> 00:13:55,489
- 1.875 pounds.
- No.

232
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,859
2 pounds.
Next Friday.

233
00:13:57,884 --> 00:14:00,143
And no production problems.

234
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:04,729
Can you handle 4 pounds?

235
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:11,327
Listen, old man.
Talk is talk.

236
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:14,257
But owing me money...

237
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:16,259
that's bad.

238
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:41,115
What did you just do?

239
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:46,455
4 pounds.

240
00:14:46,605 --> 00:14:49,521
4 pounds, as if 2 pounds
wasn't bad enough.

241
00:14:50,477 --> 00:14:53,821
We're talking 200-300
boxes of sinus pills.

242
00:14:54,552 --> 00:14:56,650
There ain't that many
smurfs in the world.

243
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:59,051
We're not going to need
pseudo ephedrine.

244
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:02,050
We're going to make phenylacetone
in a tube furnace,

245
00:15:02,122 --> 00:15:06,121
then we're gonna use reductive amination
to yield methamphetamine, 4 pounds.

246
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:08,534
- So no pseudo?
- No pseudo.

247
00:15:09,461 --> 00:15:11,227
So you do have a plan.

248
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:13,297
Yeah, Mr. White!

249
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,486
Yeah, science!

250
00:15:16,144 --> 00:15:17,115
Okay.

251
00:15:21,184 --> 00:15:23,972
- What's this?
- That is a shopping list.

252
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:28,035
Getting some of those items
may be challenging.

253
00:15:28,812 --> 00:15:32,421
"One autotransformer,
6 liters an...

254
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:36,403
hy... hydrous
methyl... methylamine,

255
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,246
two 35 M&M tube furnaces..."

256
00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:41,072
That's MM: millimeter.

257
00:15:41,096 --> 00:15:44,339
One 70-millimeter would be fine,
but they're hard to come by, so...

258
00:15:44,408 --> 00:15:46,864
"40 grams thorium nitrate"?

259
00:15:46,874 --> 00:15:49,417
Yo, Mr. White, I can't even
pronounce half this shit.

260
00:15:49,593 --> 00:15:51,183
You know what?
Count me out.

261
00:15:51,354 --> 00:15:52,597
I'm leaving town.

262
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:54,708
I'm moving to, like,
Oregon or something...

263
00:15:54,712 --> 00:15:56,639
Jesse, Jesse,
listen to me.

264
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:01,186
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

265
00:16:02,123 --> 00:16:03,384
What are you doing?

266
00:16:03,401 --> 00:16:05,529
This is the first day
of the rest of your life,

267
00:16:05,534 --> 00:16:07,552
but what kind of life will it be?

268
00:16:07,604 --> 00:16:10,655
Will be be a life of fear,
of "Oh, no, no, no,

269
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:14,496
"I can't do this," of never once
believing in yourself?

270
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,727
- I don't know.
- Listen.

271
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,575
These things?

272
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,177
We need them.

273
00:16:21,326 --> 00:16:24,203
And only you
can get them for us.

274
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,316
Okay, it's ready.
There you go.

275
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:38,407
Hi, baby. I'm your Aunt Marie.

276
00:16:39,106 --> 00:16:42,878
Now, you already know that because
when you watch this 20 years from now,

277
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,652
I will look exactly
the same as I do now.

278
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:47,500
I know it is amazing.

279
00:16:47,564 --> 00:16:50,617
I have aged shockingly well,
haven't I?

280
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:52,514
Anyway,

281
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:56,569
welcome to your
baby shower, Esmeralda!

282
00:16:57,214 --> 00:16:58,460
Esmeralda?

283
00:16:58,636 --> 00:17:00,243
Esmeralda.

284
00:17:00,257 --> 00:17:02,514
That's your name,
and you heard it here first.

285
00:17:02,536 --> 00:17:05,430
Now, that is your wonderful,

286
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,100
handsome older brother.

287
00:17:07,107 --> 00:17:09,299
Show her, older brother,
your face.

288
00:17:11,242 --> 00:17:13,146
Okay. Not right up the nose.

289
00:17:13,387 --> 00:17:15,344
Not...
Back to me.

290
00:17:15,496 --> 00:17:17,931
There's your mommy!

291
00:17:18,445 --> 00:17:20,504
Hello, Mommy!

292
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:23,886
And look!
There you are, Esmeralda!

293
00:17:24,122 --> 00:17:25,585
Wake up, baby!

294
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,559
Time to party!

295
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:29,401
Easy.

296
00:17:29,663 --> 00:17:31,970
Believe it or not,
Esmeralda,

297
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,923
right after the party,
your name was changed to Holly.

298
00:17:35,945 --> 00:17:38,304
And I believe, Hank,
that that was around the time

299
00:17:38,305 --> 00:17:40,683
that we took Aunt Marie
to the insane asylum.

300
00:17:40,689 --> 00:17:43,254
Yeah, yeah.
I dropped her off at the curb.

301
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,691
Then I married Shania Twain
and lived happily ever after.

302
00:17:48,161 --> 00:17:51,947
There's Daddy!
Speak, Daddy!

303
00:17:52,392 --> 00:17:54,474
Say hello to your daughter.

304
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:03,155
Holly, I am very proud of you,

305
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:07,090
and I think about you all the time.

306
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,922
Wherever you go,

307
00:18:14,436 --> 00:18:16,304
whatever you do in life,

308
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,046
always know
that you have a family

309
00:18:20,109 --> 00:18:22,506
who loves you very,
very much.

310
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,334
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

311
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:31,946
Oh, my God, it's so cute.

312
00:18:32,263 --> 00:18:34,423
Oh, Carmen, it's...
Oh, look.

313
00:18:34,532 --> 00:18:37,106
Look at that.
It's adorable.

314
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:39,425
I love it, Carmen.
Thank you.

315
00:18:39,463 --> 00:18:40,928
You're so welcome, honey.

316
00:18:40,941 --> 00:18:43,387
Thank you.
Look at the little feet.

317
00:18:47,685 --> 00:18:48,871
From me.

318
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,659
And Hank.

319
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:53,191
What nice wrapping paper.

320
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:55,533
Marie always finds
the best wrapping paper.

321
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,646
I do.

322
00:18:57,164 --> 00:18:58,072
Okay.

323
00:18:58,384 --> 00:19:01,443
Let's see what this is.

324
00:19:01,562 --> 00:19:02,912
Exciting.

325
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,770
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy.

326
00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:14,829
It's a...

327
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:16,669
a tiara.

328
00:19:20,271 --> 00:19:22,214
Marie, is this...

329
00:19:22,357 --> 00:19:26,355
White gold and several carats'
worth of zircons.

330
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,826
Oh, Marie, you spent
too much on this.

331
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,200
You shouldn't have.
You really, really shouldn't.

332
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,907
But it's so...
It's really...

333
00:19:34,993 --> 00:19:37,863
It's... sparkly.

334
00:19:39,121 --> 00:19:42,214
Sparkly! Like wow!
Thank you.

335
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,970
Hey, listen, Walt...

336
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:46,163
You got anything
stronger than beer?

337
00:19:46,214 --> 00:19:48,266
It's just gor...
Oh, it's great.

338
00:19:48,268 --> 00:19:50,368
I love it.
Thank you.

339
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:53,511
Thank you, sweetie,
thank you.

340
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:55,308
Sorry, man.

341
00:19:55,383 --> 00:19:58,876
You know, after 200 presents,
it just gets kind of old.

342
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:04,612
- That's nice stuff.
- It is, isn't it?

343
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,574
I got just the thing
to go with that.

344
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:17,269
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking.

345
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,218
No, no, no, no.
It's okay.

346
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:22,369
You mind
if I have one?

347
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:24,572
You think it's a good idea?

348
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:27,032
Hank, I've already got
lung cancer.

349
00:20:28,624 --> 00:20:30,984
Okay. You got me there.

350
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,622
Thanks.

351
00:20:38,032 --> 00:20:38,965
Cuban.

352
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,090
I did a little favor
for an FBI guy.

353
00:20:48,602 --> 00:20:50,884
Now, I was
under the impression...

354
00:20:52,976 --> 00:20:55,086
that these were illegal, hmm?

355
00:20:56,403 --> 00:20:59,415
Yeah, well,
sometimes forbidden fruit

356
00:20:59,453 --> 00:21:01,838
tastes the sweetest,
doesn't it?

357
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,284
It's funny, isn't it?

358
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,784
How we draw that line.

359
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:11,911
Yeah?

360
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:14,535
What line is that?

361
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,771
Well, what's legal,
what's illegal,

362
00:21:19,693 --> 00:21:21,836
Cuban cigars, alcohol.

363
00:21:22,832 --> 00:21:25,923
You know, if we were
drinking this in 1930,

364
00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:28,275
we'd be breaking the law.

365
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,975
Another year, we'd be okay.

366
00:21:33,506 --> 00:21:36,105
Who knows what
will be legal next year?

367
00:21:37,744 --> 00:21:39,535
You mean like pot?

368
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:42,676
Yeah.

369
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,238
Like pot. Or...

370
00:21:46,382 --> 00:21:47,505
whatever.

371
00:21:48,915 --> 00:21:51,148
Cocaine? Heroin?

372
00:21:53,627 --> 00:21:55,878
I'm just saying
it's arbitrary.

373
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,248
Well, you ought to visit lockup.

374
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,912
You hear a lot of guys
talking like that.

375
00:22:02,058 --> 00:22:05,896
"Hey, man, why'd you bust me
with these 14 bales of ganja?

376
00:22:05,904 --> 00:22:09,893
"It's all gonna be legal next year
when Willie Nelson's president."

377
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,760
Shit, buddy,
it doesn't only go one way, either.

378
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:17,772
Sometimes there's stuff
that's legal that shouldn't be.

379
00:22:17,947 --> 00:22:21,341
I mean, friggin' meth
used to be legal.

380
00:22:22,487 --> 00:22:26,474
Used to sell it over every counter
at every pharmacy across America.

381
00:22:26,857 --> 00:22:30,075
Thank God they came to their
senses on that one, huh?

382
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,553
Yeah.

383
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,846
Nice party.

384
00:22:52,847 --> 00:22:54,045
A tiara.

385
00:22:55,477 --> 00:22:59,060
A white gold tiara
for a newborn baby.

386
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,233
Yeah.

387
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:05,607
You know, I think she got that
at Gertrude Zachary's in Nob Hill.

388
00:23:05,658 --> 00:23:07,893
I mean, that thing
must have cost, like, what,

389
00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:10,793
$500 or $600.

390
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,897
You know what? I think
I'm going to return it.

391
00:23:16,977 --> 00:23:18,158
You sure?

392
00:23:18,594 --> 00:23:20,600
She's bound to find out.

393
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:24,888
Well, maybe I can explain to her
that we need a Diaper Genie more than

394
00:23:25,431 --> 00:23:28,106
a white gold baby tiara.

395
00:23:32,568 --> 00:23:35,576
You know, I've been thinking
about what you said to Dr. Delcavoli

396
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,462
about alternative medicine.

397
00:23:37,471 --> 00:23:40,008
Don't worry. I'm not going
to mention that anymore.

398
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,362
What I mean is that maybe
there is something to it.

399
00:23:44,604 --> 00:23:46,118
Here. Look.

400
00:23:47,197 --> 00:23:51,176
They do this Navajo sweat lodge
up by Farmington.

401
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:54,076
Healing ceremony.

402
00:23:54,103 --> 00:23:56,202
It's supposed to be
good for your lungs.

403
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,904
I'm not saying
that I believe in it, but...

404
00:23:59,513 --> 00:24:02,453
you know,
it might be an experience.

405
00:24:04,255 --> 00:24:05,303
Really?

406
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,090
You?

407
00:24:08,054 --> 00:24:09,568
In a sweat lodge?

408
00:24:09,602 --> 00:24:12,789
I was thinking about
driving up on Friday,

409
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,188
coming back Sunday.
I mean, if you're okay with it.

410
00:24:15,215 --> 00:24:17,794
Well, of course
I'm okay with that.

411
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:18,986
Okay.

412
00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:30,781
- Sweat lodge?
- Yeah.

413
00:24:31,187 --> 00:24:33,559
I'm already sweating.
Help me out.

414
00:24:34,689 --> 00:24:37,263
- Okay.
- Right.

415
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:42,775
70-millimeter tube furnace.
Excellent.

416
00:24:42,796 --> 00:24:44,587
This is excellent.
Very good work.

417
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,451
- Damn straight.
- Okay. Hydrogen.

418
00:24:46,476 --> 00:24:48,236
Electrolytically
produced, yes?

419
00:24:48,273 --> 00:24:50,105
Yeah, like you asked. I mean,

420
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,119
this crap wasn't easy to get.

421
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:53,863
It was expensive.

422
00:24:54,098 --> 00:24:56,029
Methylamine.
Where's the methylamine?

423
00:24:56,034 --> 00:24:57,922
I don't see the methylamine.

424
00:24:57,925 --> 00:25:01,251
Yeah, well, that's where
I ran into some trouble.

425
00:25:01,927 --> 00:25:03,584
What kind of trouble?

426
00:25:03,748 --> 00:25:06,598
Well, half this crap
I could just buy, right?

427
00:25:06,921 --> 00:25:08,790
But this methylamine...

428
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,629
not so easy.

429
00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:12,720
They got it locked down tight.

430
00:25:12,813 --> 00:25:16,214
But I did find some pros
who will rip it off for us.

431
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:18,768
But they want 10 grand.

432
00:25:18,913 --> 00:25:21,058
So what's the problem?
You have the money.

433
00:25:21,082 --> 00:25:24,065
No, had. I already spent
almost the whole wad.

434
00:25:24,075 --> 00:25:28,067
I mean, I got, like, 2 grand left.
I told you, all this crap was expensive.

435
00:25:28,521 --> 00:25:32,512
So these thieves, did they say where
they would be stealing it from?

436
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:35,512
Yeah, a chemical supply
place south of town.

437
00:25:35,532 --> 00:25:37,946
They got guards
and security cameras,

438
00:25:37,966 --> 00:25:39,689
big ass steel doors.

439
00:25:39,696 --> 00:25:42,709
That's why these dudes
are charging so much.

440
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:44,174
What?

441
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,932
So why don't we
just steal it ourselves?

442
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,984
Yeah?

443
00:26:05,662 --> 00:26:07,769
How are we
going to do that?

444
00:26:09,113 --> 00:26:10,249
With this.

445
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,735
So what's this
stuff called again?

446
00:26:30,742 --> 00:26:31,977
Thermite.

447
00:26:32,463 --> 00:26:34,646
And that will
cut through a lock?

448
00:26:34,892 --> 00:26:37,656
Because this is supposed
to be one big ass lock.

449
00:26:37,786 --> 00:26:39,793
In World War II,

450
00:26:40,436 --> 00:26:44,396
the Germans had an artillery piece,
it's the biggest in the world,

451
00:26:44,534 --> 00:26:46,513
called the Gustav Gun,

452
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:49,308
and it weighed
a thousand tons.

453
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,413
And the Gustav was capable
of firing a 7-ton shell

454
00:26:54,058 --> 00:26:58,045
and hitting a target
accurately 23 miles away.

455
00:26:59,605 --> 00:27:02,243
I mean, you could
drop bombs on it

456
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:05,840
every day for a month
without ever disabling it.

457
00:27:06,954 --> 00:27:09,854
But you drop
a commando,

458
00:27:10,725 --> 00:27:12,012
one man,

459
00:27:12,447 --> 00:27:14,365
with just a bag of this...

460
00:27:17,078 --> 00:27:20,124
and he could melt right through
4 inches of solid steel

461
00:27:20,126 --> 00:27:22,549
and destroy that gun forever.

462
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:26,647
Jeez!

463
00:27:30,267 --> 00:27:31,440
So yes.

464
00:27:33,006 --> 00:27:36,924
I think it will cut through any lock
we're likely to find.

465
00:27:37,742 --> 00:27:39,211
You'd like to return this?

466
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:41,858
It's very nice, but yes.

467
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:44,946
Well, it is from
the store, isn't it?

468
00:27:45,043 --> 00:27:47,301
Oh, yes.
It's from this store.

469
00:27:47,855 --> 00:27:49,861
Do you happen
to have a receipt?

470
00:27:50,217 --> 00:27:52,690
No. I don't.
It was a gift.

471
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:54,373
A gift.

472
00:27:54,811 --> 00:27:57,587
Mr. Wilson, could you
step over here, please?

473
00:27:59,588 --> 00:28:03,481
Mr. Wilson, I'd like you to watch
this lady while I phone the police.

474
00:28:04,235 --> 00:28:05,300
Excuse me?

475
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:08,603
Ma'am, this item is stolen,
as I'm sure you know.

476
00:28:09,393 --> 00:28:11,210
Come with me, please.

477
00:28:13,704 --> 00:28:16,732
Oh, yes. I intend
to press charges.

478
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:19,945
Please do.

479
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,611
We'll be here.

480
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:25,367
Look, I...

481
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,247
I've never stolen anything
in my life, all right?

482
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:30,815
I told you.

483
00:28:30,863 --> 00:28:34,602
That tiara was a gift.
A baby shower gift.

484
00:28:34,606 --> 00:28:36,775
So who gave it to you, then?

485
00:28:38,781 --> 00:28:42,119
- I don't think I have to tell you that.
- You don't have to tell me anything.

486
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:43,916
You can talk to the police,

487
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,752
and I can tell them how
my daughter-in-law remembers

488
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:50,221
showing this particular item
to a tall blonde woman who,

489
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:53,358
when her back was turned,
walked right out the door with it.

490
00:28:53,396 --> 00:28:54,512
So there.

491
00:28:54,596 --> 00:28:55,980
Oh, yeah?

492
00:28:56,429 --> 00:28:59,131
Then I can talk
to the Channel 3 News.

493
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,313
Yeah. I can tell them
how you people,

494
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,335
without a shred,
without a modicum of evidence,

495
00:29:05,351 --> 00:29:09,250
illegally detained
an innocent pregnant woman

496
00:29:09,262 --> 00:29:11,512
in a dank storeroom.

497
00:29:11,563 --> 00:29:15,182
- This is my office.
- I feel I'm being held hostage.

498
00:29:15,371 --> 00:29:19,359
Furthermore, I'm not getting
enough air back here.

499
00:29:20,348 --> 00:29:22,430
I don't think I can breathe.

500
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:24,017
Oh, my God.

501
00:29:24,105 --> 00:29:26,493
Oh, no.
I'm going into labor.

502
00:29:26,607 --> 00:29:27,919
Yes, I...

503
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:41,532
Hi. You've reached Marie.
Do the beep thing.

504
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:44,932
Marie? It's Skyler.
I just left Zachary's.

505
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:47,646
I need to talk to you
immediately.

506
00:29:50,431 --> 00:29:53,409
Where's the guard?
He's supposed to be coming by.

507
00:29:53,712 --> 00:29:56,748
- You think he already passed?
- I don't know.

508
00:29:58,152 --> 00:30:00,436
- There he is.
- Yeah, I see him.

509
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,223
Wait till he passes.

510
00:30:02,477 --> 00:30:03,953
Okay, it's clear.

511
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:14,876
- What the hell is this?
- It's all they had.

512
00:30:14,882 --> 00:30:16,516
Then you go to another store.

513
00:30:16,522 --> 00:30:19,548
- If this is all they had, wrong place.
- Just put it on.

514
00:30:19,557 --> 00:30:21,267
Of course you can...

515
00:30:30,778 --> 00:30:32,603
Okay.
This is it.

516
00:30:35,121 --> 00:30:36,244
Oh, God.

517
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:55,200
- Dawm. Where... Duck. Duck.
- What?

518
00:30:58,339 --> 00:31:01,433
He's not supposed to come back.
What's he doing?

519
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,184
Oh, God.

520
00:31:05,962 --> 00:31:07,716
He's going to the crapper.

521
00:31:07,753 --> 00:31:08,802
Oh, God.

522
00:31:10,434 --> 00:31:13,311
- Carry your bag.
- What? What are you doing?

523
00:31:46,126 --> 00:31:47,665
Okay, there is it.

524
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:51,479
Is this going to be loud?

525
00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:53,851
We'll find out
in about ten seconds.

526
00:31:55,209 --> 00:31:56,370
Stand back.

527
00:31:59,756 --> 00:32:00,715
Jesus!

528
00:32:17,221 --> 00:32:18,691
What's going on?

529
00:32:22,401 --> 00:32:25,265
- Where are the gallon jugs?
- I don't know.

530
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,623
- God!
- What?

531
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:30,806
Let's just take this.
Come on. Come on.

532
00:32:40,643 --> 00:32:42,729
What the hell are you doing
opening the door?

533
00:32:42,735 --> 00:32:45,406
How are we going to
take this thing out?

534
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,188
- How is it going to be any different?
- Can I just try it?

535
00:33:26,266 --> 00:33:28,751
- Fine, fine, go ahead.
- Jesus. Okay.

536
00:33:30,364 --> 00:33:31,323
All right.

537
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:40,687
Yeah, baby. See?
Eat it, okay?

538
00:33:40,712 --> 00:33:42,716
I'm the king.
I'm the king.

539
00:33:46,089 --> 00:33:48,663
No, no, no.
That didn't sound good.

540
00:33:54,588 --> 00:33:56,757
Well, this thing's
not going anywhere.

541
00:33:56,774 --> 00:34:00,471
We're not cooking in my damn driveway.
I tell you that.

542
00:34:07,753 --> 00:34:10,225
What part of slow it down
did you not understand?

543
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:13,964
You talk too much. It's heavy, man.
You got to wait for me.

544
00:34:14,857 --> 00:34:15,809
Okay.

545
00:34:16,339 --> 00:34:19,024
That's good, that's good.
Now just bring it up.

546
00:34:20,312 --> 00:34:21,751
Easy, easy, easy.

547
00:34:22,118 --> 00:34:23,140
Okay.

548
00:34:23,623 --> 00:34:27,143
Your real estate agent,
when is she supposed to come back?

549
00:34:27,494 --> 00:34:28,683
Shit.

550
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,993
Yo, I don't know.

551
00:34:31,304 --> 00:34:33,487
I'll make damn sure
she doesn't.

552
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:37,963
Good call, yo.

553
00:34:40,108 --> 00:34:41,307
All right.

554
00:35:11,921 --> 00:35:15,585
Keep the temperature steady
at 425 degrees.

555
00:35:16,257 --> 00:35:18,695
We'll need to run it
two more hours

556
00:35:18,705 --> 00:35:21,031
to have enough
to make 4½ pounds.

557
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:23,560
4½? Not 4?

558
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:25,858
2 pounds pays Tuco back.

559
00:35:27,063 --> 00:35:31,051
4½ pounds puts us
$44,000 ahead...

560
00:35:31,353 --> 00:35:32,291
each.

561
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,955
Right on, man.

562
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,069
Right on.

563
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,914
With the amount of methylamine
that we got last night,

564
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:41,737
we could make
4½ pounds a week for...

565
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:44,849
well, for the foreseeable future.

566
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:49,045
How long is
that going to be?

567
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,213
I mean in your situation.

568
00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:55,235
How much
cash do you need?

569
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:58,277
More.

570
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,866
Someone's in my yard.

571
00:36:32,963 --> 00:36:36,953
Was there, by any chance, scheduled
for this afternoon an open house?

572
00:36:37,939 --> 00:36:40,571
I left them a message, man.
It's not my fault.

573
00:36:40,572 --> 00:36:43,894
I don't care how you do it. Just keep
them out of here. Do you understand?

574
00:36:43,932 --> 00:36:45,741
- Yeah.
- Go.

575
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:17,260
You know you can't
duck me forever.

576
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,239
What?

577
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:21,302
Come on. I left you,
like, 15 messages.

578
00:37:21,392 --> 00:37:23,735
When I went to your office,
you snuck out the back way.

579
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:27,015
I didn't sneak.
I was going to lunch.

580
00:37:27,103 --> 00:37:29,929
Jeez, Skyler, what are you,
the paranoid police?

581
00:37:30,134 --> 00:37:33,451
Marie, I have never been
so humiliated in my life.

582
00:37:36,191 --> 00:37:38,059
That tiara.

583
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:43,372
They accused me at Zachary's
of shoplifting it.

584
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:45,942
What were you doing
at Zachary's?

585
00:37:46,763 --> 00:37:48,378
I was returning it.

586
00:37:49,391 --> 00:37:51,322
You were returning it.

587
00:37:52,641 --> 00:37:54,210
Why would you return it?

588
00:37:54,247 --> 00:37:55,554
It just wasn't...

589
00:37:56,755 --> 00:37:59,518
Marie, what is wrong with you?

590
00:37:59,523 --> 00:38:01,055
Can you please tell me that?

591
00:38:01,064 --> 00:38:04,065
Can you tell me why
you'd do such a thing?

592
00:38:07,935 --> 00:38:11,153
What does that mean?
Does that mean you don't know?

593
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:14,336
That means that

594
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:17,944
I have no idea what the hell
you're even talking about.

595
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:21,089
You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

596
00:38:21,228 --> 00:38:24,789
The shop...
The shoplifting.

597
00:38:25,317 --> 00:38:26,453
No idea?

598
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:31,713
You're not going
to admit this, are you?

599
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:36,720
I can't really admit to something

600
00:38:36,724 --> 00:38:40,555
when I have no knowledge
of what it is that I'm admitting.

601
00:38:59,846 --> 00:39:01,836
Don't forget to sign in.

602
00:39:07,835 --> 00:39:09,577
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

603
00:39:27,918 --> 00:39:30,531
Excuse me. I'd just like
to see the basement.

604
00:39:30,617 --> 00:39:33,194
- Yeah, well, it's occupied.
- It's not a bathroom.

605
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:36,560
I just want to see the basement.
What's the big deal?

606
00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:40,069
Yo, you ain't seeing
the basement, bitch. You got that?

607
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:42,092
Is that sinking in?
Now beat it.

608
00:39:42,154 --> 00:39:44,615
All of you all.
House is not for sale.

609
00:39:44,874 --> 00:39:46,539
Get the hell out!

610
00:40:31,407 --> 00:40:32,946
So how was it?

611
00:40:33,553 --> 00:40:34,827
Was it a...

612
00:40:35,515 --> 00:40:37,263
an experience?

613
00:40:37,799 --> 00:40:38,682
Yeah.

614
00:40:39,323 --> 00:40:41,606
It was definitely
an experience.

615
00:40:48,435 --> 00:40:50,052
What's that smell?

616
00:40:51,954 --> 00:40:53,305
Yeah. It's...

617
00:40:54,215 --> 00:40:56,637
sacred Navajo herbs and...

618
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,781
Hey,
is everything okay?

619
00:41:14,861 --> 00:41:17,271
No. Not really.

620
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,633
Actually, not at all.

621
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,177
You know that tiara
that Marie gave us?

622
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:29,199
Yeah.

623
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:32,075
Well, she stole it.

624
00:41:33,012 --> 00:41:33,958
Yeah.

625
00:41:34,212 --> 00:41:37,808
I practically got arrested
trying to return it at the store.

626
00:41:38,478 --> 00:41:39,788
Oh, my God.

627
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,727
She refuses to admit it.
She refuses to apologize.

628
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:45,793
I don't know
what to do.

629
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:51,523
Oh, well.

630
00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:56,203
People sometimes do things
for their families.

631
00:41:58,723 --> 00:42:02,018
People sometimes do things
for their families?

632
00:42:02,496 --> 00:42:05,058
And, what,
that justifies stealing?

633
00:42:06,731 --> 00:42:07,755
Yeah.

634
00:42:09,484 --> 00:42:12,046
That must have
been some sweat lodge.

635
00:42:13,134 --> 00:42:16,815
Have you been listening
to the words coming out of your mouth?

636
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,616
What would you do
if it were me?

637
00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:27,275
What do you mean
if it were you?

638
00:42:27,953 --> 00:42:30,350
If it were me,
what would you do?

639
00:42:30,879 --> 00:42:34,494
Would you divorce me?
Would you turn me in to the police?

640
00:42:44,894 --> 00:42:47,010
You don't want to find out.

641
00:42:58,332 --> 00:43:00,439
Do you want
something to eat?

642
00:43:04,305 --> 00:43:05,958
No, thanks.

643
00:43:22,373 --> 00:43:24,670
What is this shit?
This is blue.

644
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:30,544
We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

645
00:43:30,993 --> 00:43:33,655
It may be blue,
but it's the bomb.

646
00:43:41,757 --> 00:43:43,687
Tight! Tight, tight, yeah!

647
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:46,677
Blue, yellow, pink.

648
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:49,702
Whatever, man.
Just keep bringing me that.

649
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,313
4.6.

650
00:44:02,236 --> 00:44:03,283
Come on.

651
00:44:04,796 --> 00:44:07,711
And what did I say, man?
This guy can cook!

652
00:44:08,183 --> 00:44:10,306
You're all right, man.
You're all right.

653
00:44:10,311 --> 00:44:13,135
We're going to make
a lot of money together.

654
00:44:13,973 --> 00:44:16,509
Just remember
who you're working for.

655
00:44:19,438 --> 00:44:20,928
What did you say?

656
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:24,968
I'm just saying they got to know
that they're working for you.

657
00:44:25,052 --> 00:44:27,713
Like they don't
already know that?

658
00:44:28,218 --> 00:44:30,590
Are you saying
that they're stupid?

659
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:34,260
No, I'm just...
I'm just saying.

660
00:44:34,757 --> 00:44:37,281
Oh, yeah. So you're not
saying that they're stupid.

661
00:44:37,345 --> 00:44:40,433
So I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

662
00:44:40,474 --> 00:44:43,143
No. Come on, Tuco.
I'm just saying.

663
00:44:43,148 --> 00:44:45,412
No, you're just
speaking for me!

664
00:44:45,462 --> 00:44:49,222
Like I ain't got the damn sense
to speak for myself!

665
00:44:50,072 --> 00:44:52,885
Is that it? Is that
what you're doing?

666
00:44:53,614 --> 00:44:54,457
Tuco.

667
00:44:58,238 --> 00:45:01,847
Hey, why don't we
all just relax, huh?

668
00:45:09,236 --> 00:45:11,545
Heisenberg says relax.

669
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,415
Orale, homes.

670
00:45:18,354 --> 00:45:19,667
I'm relaxed.

671
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,952
I'm relaxed.
I'm relaxed.

672
00:45:38,868 --> 00:45:41,170
Damn, man!
Look at that! Look!

673
00:45:43,903 --> 00:45:46,174
Yeah. That's messed up.

674
00:45:48,183 --> 00:45:49,910
Okay, Heisenberg!

675
00:45:50,777 --> 00:45:52,102
Next week.

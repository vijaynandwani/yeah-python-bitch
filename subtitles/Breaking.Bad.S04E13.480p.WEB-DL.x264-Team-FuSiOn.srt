00:01:05,056 --> 00:01:06,528
What did you say to Gus?

7
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,608
Because he's on to us.
Yeah.

8
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,272
I didn't say jack.
What do you mean he's on to us?

9
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:13,280
He's walking to his car.
Then suddenly he isn't.

10
00:01:13,312 --> 00:01:15,520
What, does he have
some kind of sixth sense?

11
00:01:15,552 --> 00:01:17,216
Jesus, what did you say to him?

12
00:01:17,248 --> 00:01:20,960
Could I ask my own question
right now, at this point?

13
00:01:20,992 --> 00:01:23,488
Did you just bring a bomb
into a hospital?

14
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,944
What? Was I supposed
to leave it on his car?

15
00:01:26,976 --> 00:01:28,992
What, you're supposed
to bring it into a hospital?

16
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:31,904
[panting] Oh, my God.

17
00:01:31,936 --> 00:01:36,800
Look. Where can we find Gus?
Name a place.

18
00:01:36,832 --> 00:01:38,752
Name me one place
where I could surprise him,

19
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,128
where he won't see me coming.

20
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:45,408
Because his house, the laundry,

21
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,232
the restaurant,
the factory farm,

22
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,704
they're all wired with cameras.

23
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:51,136
One place.

24
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:52,576
Think.

25
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:53,824
Jesse, think.

26
00:01:53,856 --> 00:01:56,064
Where is it?
Where?

27
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:58,720
Because if you can't tell me,

28
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,960
we are dead.

29
00:02:03,232 --> 00:02:05,600
[panting]

30
00:02:10,336 --> 00:02:12,736
Jesse.

31
00:02:12,768 --> 00:02:14,528
I don't-- I don't know.

32
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,832
Well, maybe--

33
00:02:16,864 --> 00:02:19,424
Excuse me.
Jesse Pinkman?

34
00:02:19,456 --> 00:02:20,608
Uh, yeah.

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,592
Hi.
Detective Kalanchoe.

36
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:25,216
This is Detective Munn,
Albuquerque Police.

37
00:02:25,248 --> 00:02:27,776
We were wondering if we could
have a few minutes of your time,

38
00:02:27,808 --> 00:02:29,248
maybe go someplace and talk.

39
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,560
About what?

40
00:02:30,592 --> 00:02:32,128
Sorry, sir,
I didn't catch your name.

41
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,280
About what?

42
00:02:33,312 --> 00:02:35,200
It concerns Brock Cantillo

43
00:02:35,232 --> 00:02:37,792
and a statement
you made to his mother.

44
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,456
How about you come with us?

45
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,824
We just want to clear
a few things up. No big deal.

47
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:21,152
[Jesse] Am I under arrest?

48
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:23,616
[Kalanchoe]
No, you're not under arrest.

49
00:03:23,648 --> 00:03:24,928
We're just talking.

50
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,720
So if I get tired of talking,

51
00:03:26,752 --> 00:03:27,968
want to get up and leave--

52
00:03:28,032 --> 00:03:29,408
We'd prefer you didn't.

53
00:03:30,784 --> 00:03:32,672
You'd prefer, so--

54
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,208
Jesse, why did you
tell Brock's mom

55
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,280
that the boy had been poisoned?

56
00:03:37,312 --> 00:03:42,368
Look, I think this has been,
you know,

57
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
uh, what do you call it?

58
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:47,264
Overblown, because
all I basically said was

59
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:51,328
"Have the doctors thought
maybe Brock got poisoned?"

60
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,504
You know, in a cover-all-bases
kind of sense.

61
00:03:53,536 --> 00:03:56,224
Yeah. No, I'm sure
they appreciated that,

62
00:03:56,256 --> 00:03:57,856
you helping them out like that,

63
00:03:57,888 --> 00:03:59,904
especially with how specific
you were and all.

64
00:03:59,936 --> 00:04:01,952
Ricin. Wow.

65
00:04:01,984 --> 00:04:04,384
[Kalanchoe] Yeah, ricin--
that's definitely a big one.

66
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,696
You don't see that every day,

67
00:04:05,728 --> 00:04:07,200
so when doctors,
they hear that,

68
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:09,216
they take it very seriously,

69
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:11,200
as do we,

70
00:04:11,232 --> 00:04:12,960
as does the FBI.

71
00:04:12,992 --> 00:04:14,432
Okay.

72
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,056
And nice, you trying to
help out like that and all,

73
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:19,200
you know,
professional courtesy,

74
00:04:19,232 --> 00:04:21,376
sharing your expertise.

75
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:24,512
I ain't go no expertise.

76
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:26,080
All right?
I just, you know--

77
00:04:26,112 --> 00:04:28,480
You just happen to guess
this one rare poison

78
00:04:28,512 --> 00:04:31,232
might be the thing that put this
little boy in the hospital.

79
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:33,696
And congratulations,
because his doctors,

80
00:04:33,728 --> 00:04:36,320
they're beginning to think
that you might just be right.

81
00:04:36,352 --> 00:04:38,016
So why ricin?

82
00:04:38,048 --> 00:04:39,296
Jesse, how did you come up
with that?

83
00:04:39,328 --> 00:04:42,112
[sighs]
Man, I think I've--

84
00:04:42,144 --> 00:04:44,864
I don't know. I must've saw it
on <i>House</i> or something.

85
00:04:44,896 --> 00:04:45,920
Huh.

86
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,008
Yeah, you know, like <i>House</i>

87
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,344
or the Discovery Channel.

88
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:52,224
Sometimes your brain just
makes these connections.

89
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:54,240
- Does it?
- Mine does.

90
00:04:54,272 --> 00:04:56,192
That's interesting.

91
00:04:56,224 --> 00:04:58,880
Look, I've got to get back.

92
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:00,576
But we're still talking.

93
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:04,992
So I'm not under arrest,
but I can't leave.

94
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:12,480
So, then, I guess I should
call my lawyer. Right?

95
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,712
We're just having
a simple conversation, Jess.

96
00:05:15,776 --> 00:05:18,624
Why can't we keep talking,
keep it light?

97
00:05:18,656 --> 00:05:21,056
Man, you know how it is
when the lawyers get to it.

98
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:23,744
Suddenly everything's
a big pissing match,

Adversarial.

101
00:05:26,304 --> 00:05:28,704
Adversarial. Then we gotta
book you, blah, blah. Right?

102
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:31,200
I mean, you know.
You've been around the block, Jesse.

103
00:05:32,224 --> 00:05:33,952
You're no boy scout.

104
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,856
Saul Goodman.

105
00:05:37,888 --> 00:05:40,032
That's my guy.

106
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:42,848
So do I gotta call him,
or do you?

I need him right now.

119
00:06:23,904 --> 00:06:26,336
So you break into the place.
You just break in! Jesus!

120
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:27,712
You're here, by the way.

If you'd had bothered answering
the phone or the door,

00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,096
maybe I wouldn't have--
Forget it.

123
00:06:32,128 --> 00:06:33,120
Is he here?

124
00:06:33,152 --> 00:06:34,336
Is that a serious question?

125
00:06:34,368 --> 00:06:36,032
Why would he be here?

126
00:06:36,064 --> 00:06:37,472
You know where he is,
don't you?

127
00:06:37,504 --> 00:06:38,624
I need a number.

128

[laughs]

129
00:06:39,712 --> 00:06:42,144
Look. Let me explain
something to you.

130
00:06:42,176 --> 00:06:44,128
- My partner and I--
- Are in danger?

131
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,728
Whoop-dee-freaking-doo.

132
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,008
Why do you think he's not here?

133
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,960
And how's that news, exactly,

134
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,104
the two of you being in danger,

135
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:52,928
after doing something idiotic?

136
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,776
And what gives you the right
to break down my door?

137
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:58,560
Look, I just need a number.
Okay? That's all.

138
00:06:58,592 --> 00:07:00,704
You are such a pain in my ass.

139
00:07:00,736 --> 00:07:02,304
You know that?

140
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:03,616
You're the reason
I've got to go on unemployment

141
00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:05,408
for God knows how long.

142
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,560
I was at least looking forward

143
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,192
to getting out of here
in the next half hour,

144
00:07:08,224 --> 00:07:09,248
but no!

145
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,040
Now I've got to wait
around all day

146
00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:13,120
for a plate glass guy
to come and fix this door,

147
00:07:13,152 --> 00:07:14,240
and who pays for this?

148
00:07:14,272 --> 00:07:16,672
Okay, you know what?

149
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:18,496
Here, look.
I'm giving you everything,

150
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:19,936
all of it, okay?

151
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:21,792
There's one, two, three--

152
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:25,344
Look, there's got to be
at least $1,700 there, okay?

153
00:07:25,376 --> 00:07:26,880
That will more than cover
the cost of the door.

154
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:28,736
Now, I apologize profusely.

155
00:07:28,768 --> 00:07:30,688
Please, the phone number.

156
00:07:32,864 --> 00:07:36,224
Door like this is going to
cost way more than 1,700.

157
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,624
What? For a plate of glass?
No.

158
00:07:38,656 --> 00:07:41,056
Oh, yeah, I bet it does.

159
00:07:41,088 --> 00:07:42,944
I bet you
it winds up costing...

160
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,592
20,000.

161
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:48,704
[chuckles]

162
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:50,176
Are you insane?

163
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,416
Who the hell is going
to charge $20,000

164
00:07:52,448 --> 00:07:54,464
for a plate glass door?

165

he was torturing the old guy.

What does that mean?

He told him the last

He seemed to enjoy telling him.

Afterward, Pinkman
asked him about it.

All Gus would say
was that this Tio character

When exactly
are you getting here?

<i>Uh, just as soon as I can.</i>

00:20:44,832 --> 00:20:46,720
Look, this is
a serious situation,

370
00:20:46,752 --> 00:20:48,576
and it's like you're not
taking it seriously.

371
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:49,920
Give me the phone.
Let me talk to him.

Walt.

I can assure you there's
no interest in me.

I'm not on--

<i>- and besides your mother and I.</i>
- Give it to me.

Walter?

380
00:21:08,864 --> 00:21:10,272
Did you hear what he said?

381
00:21:10,304 --> 00:21:11,616
Get over here.

00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:16,064
Marie, I will be there
just as soon as I can.

384
00:21:16,096 --> 00:21:17,344
- I promise.
<i>- Hold on.</i>

You want to weigh in here?

386
00:21:20,224 --> 00:21:22,016
Maybe you could talk
some sense into him.

387
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,184
Marie, he'll get here
when he gets here, so just...

388
00:21:28,512 --> 00:21:30,688
Well, I hope you sell

for all of your help.

395
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,776
Huh?

396
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,664
Anything?

397
00:22:10,368 --> 00:22:12,576
- Hi, everyone.
[Skyler] - Hi, Steve.

00:22:12,608 --> 00:22:13,664
How's everybody holding up?

399
00:22:13,696 --> 00:22:15,616
Hey, Gomie,
just the man I want to see.

400
00:22:15,648 --> 00:22:16,768
Come here, look at this.

401
00:22:18,528 --> 00:22:20,192
Jesus, enough with the laundry.

402
00:22:20,224 --> 00:22:21,888
No, no, no, hear me out.

403
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,032
This panel,
if I'm reading it correctly,

404
00:22:24,064 --> 00:22:26,240
is a 7,200-amp service.

405
00:22:26,272 --> 00:22:27,392
This place has two of them.

406
00:22:27,424 --> 00:22:28,512
[sighs] All right?

407
00:22:28,544 --> 00:22:30,592
That's a whole lot of juice,
brother.

408
00:22:30,624 --> 00:22:33,504
Laundry this size typically
has maybe half that, okay?

409
00:22:33,536 --> 00:22:35,232
So what's with the extra panel?

410
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,736
What are you,
Thomas Edison now?

411
00:22:36,768 --> 00:22:38,464
No, I asked
a bunch of electricians.

412
00:22:38,496 --> 00:22:39,808
[chuckles] They have
their own chat rooms,

413
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,240
you know, like where all
they talk about was wiring?

414
00:22:42,272 --> 00:22:45,440
Freakin' Internet-- find
anything on it these days.

415
00:22:45,472 --> 00:22:46,784
What do you say?

416
00:22:46,816 --> 00:22:48,768
Pop over,
have another look-see?

417
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,160
Listen.

418
00:22:53,888 --> 00:22:56,256
I think we possibly have
a lead on something.

419
00:22:56,288 --> 00:22:57,472
Yeah?

420
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,296
I have this guy
down at the office.

421
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,504
He says he has
some kind of information.

422
00:23:01,536 --> 00:23:04,128
The thing is,
he'll only give it to you,

423
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,920
in person.

424
00:23:11,936 --> 00:23:13,184
Okay.

425
00:23:13,216 --> 00:23:14,656
Remember Hector Salamanca?

426
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,936
Sh-- Yeah.

427
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:17,984
What, you mean the old
cripple guy with the bell?

428
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,712
Rather crap on our floor
than talk to us?

429
00:23:19,744 --> 00:23:21,312
No, I don't remember him
at all. Why?

430
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,904
Well, he's the guy.

431
00:23:23,968 --> 00:23:25,120
His nurse calls us,

432
00:23:25,152 --> 00:23:27,904
says he wants to powwow.

433
00:23:27,936 --> 00:23:29,536
So we have this guy
at the office

434
00:23:29,568 --> 00:23:30,976
for three hours,

435
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:33,600
and he still just wants
to talk to you.

436
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:37,600
Do not even think
about going down there.

437
00:23:37,632 --> 00:23:38,752
Marie.

438
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:40,032
This is clearly a ploy

439
00:23:40,064 --> 00:23:41,344
or a trick or something

440
00:23:41,376 --> 00:23:43,904
designed to get Hank
out into the open.

441
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:45,024
That's all this is.

442
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,272
That's what we thought.

443
00:23:46,304 --> 00:23:47,648
Well.

444
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,176
It's been years since
this guy's been a player.

445
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:51,584
His nephew's gone.

446
00:23:51,616 --> 00:23:52,864
Doesn't have anybody.

447
00:23:52,928 --> 00:23:55,168
The nurse checks out--
doesn't know nothing.

448
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,432
Guess I just don't see
an angle in it,

449
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,384
if there even is one.

450
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:03,680
Of course, if you did want
to talk to this guy,

451
00:24:03,712 --> 00:24:05,440
there's not safer place
than the office.

452
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,896
I don't think this sounds
like a good idea.

453
00:24:08,928 --> 00:24:10,240
Yeah, I agree, Uncle Hank.

454
00:24:10,272 --> 00:24:12,608
It is a ridiculous idea,

455
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,008
and there is no way
you are going to do it,

456
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,352
end of story.

457
00:24:18,368 --> 00:24:20,704
Hank, thanks for coming down.

458
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,424
[Hank] No problem at all.
Good to see you, sir.

459
00:24:33,408 --> 00:24:36,480
So Mr. Salamanca.

460
00:24:36,512 --> 00:24:37,856

you want to tell me?

and sometimes
little kids eat them

657
00:45:28,416 --> 00:45:29,696
and wind up poisoning
themselves,

658
00:45:29,728 --> 00:45:31,584
and that's it,

659
00:45:31,616 --> 00:45:33,504
nothing more.

660
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,152
So Gus didn't poison him
after all.

661
00:45:46,528 --> 00:45:48,288
Still, he--

662
00:45:50,016 --> 00:45:53,248
he had to go, right?

663
00:45:56,192 --> 00:45:58,272
You're damn right.

664
00:45:58,304 --> 00:45:59,648
Gus had to go.

665
00:46:07,584 --> 00:46:09,824
Um, you know, I should--

666
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:12,672
I should get back.

667
00:46:12,704 --> 00:46:14,048
Andrea's waiting.

668
00:46:59,136 --> 00:47:01,600
[dials]

669
00:47:01,632 --> 00:47:04,928
<i>I'm here at Casa Tranquila,</i> <i>where three
people are dead</i> <i>following an explosion</i>

670
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,224

[phone ringing]

672
00:47:09,728 --> 00:47:11,712
<i>The fireball completely</i>

673
00:47:11,744 --> 00:47:12,928
<i>and damaged common areas</i>
<i>nearby.</i>

674
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,208
Walt?
<i>[Newscaster continues]</i>

675
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,584
- Tell Dad to turn on his TV.
- Shh.

676
00:47:15,616 --> 00:47:16,736
Walt, let me get somewhere
where I can hear you.

677
00:47:16,768 --> 00:47:18,816
- Tell him Uncle Hank was right.
- Shh.

678
00:47:18,848 --> 00:47:20,256
Walt?

679
00:47:20,288 --> 00:47:21,408
<i>[Walt]</i> <i>How are you doing?</i>

680
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,520
How am I doing?
How are you doing?

681
00:47:23,552 --> 00:47:25,472
I'm, uh...

682
00:47:28,064 --> 00:47:29,664
I'm doing quite well.

683
00:47:31,008 --> 00:47:33,856
[sighs] I'm good.

684
00:47:33,888 --> 00:47:36,640
Jesus, Walt, the news here.

685
00:47:36,672 --> 00:47:38,176
Gus Fring is dead.

686
00:47:38,208 --> 00:47:40,320
<i>He was blown up along</i>
<i>with some person</i>

687
00:47:40,352 --> 00:47:42,592
<i>from some Mexican cartel,</i>

688
00:47:42,656 --> 00:47:45,216
<i>and the DEA has no idea</i>
<i>what to make of it.</i>

689
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,352
Do you know about this?

690
00:47:48,384 --> 00:47:51,104
<i>Walt?</i> <i>I need you to--</i>

691
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:52,960
It's over.

692
00:47:52,992 --> 00:47:54,368
We're safe.

693
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,280
<i>[Newscaster continuing]</i>
[heavy breathing]

694
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:09,824
Was this you?

695
00:48:12,768 --> 00:48:14,432
<i>What happened?</i>

696
00:48:16,288 --> 00:48:17,984
I won.

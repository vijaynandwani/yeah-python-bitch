1
00:00:52,547 --> 00:00:54,288
Let's get something straight.

2
00:00:54,413 --> 00:00:57,405
This, the chemistry,
is my realm.

3
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,808
I am in charge of the cooking.

4
00:00:59,921 --> 00:01:02,929
Out there on the street,
you deal with that.

5
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:08,903
As far as our customers go,
I don't wanna know anything about them.

6
00:01:08,973 --> 00:01:11,598
I don't want to see them.
I don't want to hear from them.

7
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:14,549
I want no interaction
with them whatsoever.

8
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:22,045
This operation is you and me,
and I'm the silent partner.

9
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:24,471
You got any issues
with that?

10
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,134
Whatever, man.

11
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:35,650
No matter what happens,

12
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:38,042
no more bloodshed.

13
00:01:39,446 --> 00:01:40,863
No violence.

14
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,904
"Crazy Handful of Nothin'"

15
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:35,782
Walt?

16
00:02:36,955 --> 00:02:39,059
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.

17
00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:41,160
Yeah. I'm okay.

18
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,497
You know, honey,
you really don't have to...

19
00:02:47,178 --> 00:02:50,259
Look,
I like being here with you.

20
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:55,180
I'm only saying that,

21
00:02:55,268 --> 00:02:58,664
I'd be okay with it, really,
if you want to go.

22
00:03:00,365 --> 00:03:02,959
You know, actually,

23
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:05,960
it would make me feel a little better
knowing that you were there

24
00:03:05,961 --> 00:03:09,006
when Walter Jr.
gets home from school.

25
00:03:12,529 --> 00:03:13,318
Okay.

26
00:03:15,893 --> 00:03:16,960
All right.

27
00:03:17,045 --> 00:03:19,970
- You'll call me when you're finished?
- Oh, yeah.

28
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,412
And have you been
in touch with Elliott?

29
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:29,952
Because I haven't
seen a check from him.

30
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:31,895
Yes, I got it.

31
00:03:32,465 --> 00:03:34,387
- Really?
- It came, yeah.

32
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:37,517
Yeah, it came last week,

33
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,207
and I put it right into
my credit union account, so...

34
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:43,699
Taken care of it.

35
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:46,443
Good.

36
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,900
So we're good. We're good.

37
00:03:53,152 --> 00:03:56,121
Could you not deposit this

38
00:03:56,497 --> 00:03:58,300
until Monday?

39
00:04:00,982 --> 00:04:01,959
Thank you.

40
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,660
Call if the discomfort's too much.

41
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,034
Otherwise,
we'll see you next week.

42
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:08,286
Yeah.

43
00:04:29,827 --> 00:04:33,747
Chemical reactions
involve change on two levels:

44
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:35,740
matter and energy.

45
00:04:36,936 --> 00:04:39,352
When a reaction is gradual,

46
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:42,937
the change in energy is slight.

47
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,404
I mean, you don't even notice
the reaction is happening.

48
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:47,870
For example,

49
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:52,182
when rust collects
on the underside of a car.

50
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:00,903
But if a reaction
happens quickly,

51
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:05,533
otherwise harmless substances
can interact in a way

52
00:05:05,603 --> 00:05:09,553
that generates
enormous bursts of energy.

53
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:17,211
Who can give me an example

54
00:05:17,225 --> 00:05:20,004
of rapid chemical reaction?

55
00:05:25,265 --> 00:05:27,431
Hint, hint. Right here.

56
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,109
Like an explosion?

57
00:05:31,236 --> 00:05:32,425
Yes. Good.

58
00:05:32,847 --> 00:05:34,150
Explosions.

59
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:36,907
Explosions are the result

60
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:39,061
of chemical reactions

61
00:05:39,301 --> 00:05:41,832
happening almost
instantaneously.

62
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:45,533
And the faster reactants,
i. e., explosives,

63
00:05:45,765 --> 00:05:49,135
and fulminative mercury
is a prime example of that,

64
00:05:49,838 --> 00:05:52,443
the faster
they undergo change,

65
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,298
the more violent
the explosion.

66
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:00,956
So... explosions.

67
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:05,241
Okay, listen. Why don't you
start reading on your own

68
00:06:05,242 --> 00:06:08,711
from the top of chapter 7,
all right?

69
00:06:23,565 --> 00:06:24,742
You okay?

70
00:06:26,203 --> 00:06:28,145
I got it, Mr. White.

71
00:06:28,506 --> 00:06:29,905
Don't worry.

72
00:06:30,218 --> 00:06:32,259
You got kids to teach.

73
00:06:52,796 --> 00:06:54,223
Thanks, Hugo.

74
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,321
He's starting to lose weight,

75
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:10,469
which is tough...

76
00:07:12,135 --> 00:07:13,437
to see that.

77
00:07:13,852 --> 00:07:16,147
You know, to feel
the difference when I put my

78
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:18,482
arms around him.

79
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:29,032
- Can I talk to him?
- Of course.

80
00:07:30,481 --> 00:07:31,358
Walt...

81
00:07:34,596 --> 00:07:38,469
when you don't let me in,
when you don't tell me what's going on,

82
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:42,832
I think it's like I feel like you don't
even want me around sometimes.

83
00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:43,747
No.

84
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:47,883
And recently these afternoons,

85
00:07:48,316 --> 00:07:50,848
when you're
coming home so late

86
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:53,471
and we're
just left wondering

87
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,421
where you are.

88
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,073
Yeah, Dad.

89
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,525
What's up with that?

90
00:08:03,022 --> 00:08:06,230
Walt,
is there anything else

91
00:08:06,706 --> 00:08:09,273
you're holding back
from your family?

92
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,050
Now's the time to share.

93
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:18,164
Well...

94
00:08:23,443 --> 00:08:26,126
I like to be alone,
I mean at times,

95
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,799
and it's not
about you, really.

96
00:08:30,255 --> 00:08:33,217
It's just that sometimes
it feels better

97
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,649
not to talk at all...

98
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,965
about anything,
to anyone.

99
00:08:44,026 --> 00:08:46,890
Alone time can be helpful
for some types.

100
00:08:49,315 --> 00:08:52,184
Maybe knowing what you do
when you're alone

101
00:08:53,286 --> 00:08:55,879
might make it easier
for your family

102
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:59,860
to be more accepting
of whatever it is you do alone.

103
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:03,415
Well...

104
00:09:05,537 --> 00:09:08,405
I like to go on walks

105
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,030
a couple of times a week,
maybe more, after work,

106
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:19,071
And I really
enjoy the nature.

107
00:09:20,706 --> 00:09:23,060
You know, the cacti,

108
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,206
the vegetation,
that kind of thing.

109
00:09:29,173 --> 00:09:33,157
It's really
very therapeutic.

110
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:05,088
Yo! You okay?

111
00:10:06,235 --> 00:10:09,403
- Did you breathe that shit?
- No. I'm just dizzy.

112
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,277
Come here.

113
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:14,414
- Sit down, sit down.
- I'm burning up.

114
00:10:14,444 --> 00:10:15,834
Take this off.

115
00:10:18,776 --> 00:10:20,768
Sit down. Get some air.

116
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,526
Oh, God.

117
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:33,123
Yeah, that's better.

118
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:41,300
When were you
going to tell me?

119
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:45,529
Tell you what?

120
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:47,498
Cancer.

121
00:10:48,344 --> 00:10:50,075
You got it, right?

122
00:10:57,446 --> 00:10:58,999
How did you know?

123
00:10:59,061 --> 00:11:02,670
My aunt had one
of those dots on her,

124
00:11:03,553 --> 00:11:05,287
to target the radiation.

125
00:11:05,325 --> 00:11:07,301
What is it, in your lung?

126
00:11:08,514 --> 00:11:11,312
I'm your partner, man.
You should have told me.

127
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,155
That's not cool,
okay? Not at all.

128
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:19,090
What stage are you?

129
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:21,869
3a.

130
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:26,707
Gone to your lymph nodes.

131
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,303
Your aunt.

132
00:11:41,477 --> 00:11:43,982
How bad was she
when they caught it?

133
00:11:44,842 --> 00:11:47,461
Bad enough.
She didn't last long.

134
00:11:49,323 --> 00:11:50,299
How long?

135
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,341
Seven months.

136
00:11:59,123 --> 00:12:00,540
I get it now.

137
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:03,157
That's why
you're doing all this.

138
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,812
You want to make some cash for
your people before you check out.

139
00:12:06,831 --> 00:12:09,069
- You got a problem with that?
- You tell me.

140
00:12:09,072 --> 00:12:12,933
You're the one that looks like you
just crawled out of a microwave.

141
00:12:18,373 --> 00:12:20,678
You going to be able
to finish the batch?

142
00:12:20,803 --> 00:12:21,610
Yes.

143
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:23,858
All right.

144
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:28,720
No.

145
00:12:30,736 --> 00:12:32,051
You do it.

146
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:35,793
Me?

147
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:37,750
Yeah.

148
00:12:38,746 --> 00:12:41,953
What happened
to your mad skills?

149
00:12:48,207 --> 00:12:49,610
Go on. Here.

150
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:51,631
You do it.

151
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:56,907
You can do it.

152
00:13:02,452 --> 00:13:05,507
If you have any questions,
I'll be right out here.

153
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:14,465
The next time, put an ice pack
on your head during chemo.

154
00:13:15,849 --> 00:13:18,742
My aunt said it helped
with the hair loss.

155
00:13:55,766 --> 00:13:58,020
What's this? Christmas?

156
00:14:01,364 --> 00:14:04,617
This the one we found way out
in the boonies, the cook site?

157
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:09,960
- Holy shit.
- What?

158
00:14:10,228 --> 00:14:12,419
Lab pulled up an imprint
of some old writing

159
00:14:12,424 --> 00:14:15,229
that used to be on the inside.
Old Magic Marker or something.

160
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:16,726
Yeah? What's it say?

161
00:14:16,804 --> 00:14:19,572
"Property of J.P. Wynne
Chemistry Lab."

162
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:22,425
That's Walt's school.

163
00:15:41,537 --> 00:15:43,917
We were supposed
to start at 3.

164
00:15:44,017 --> 00:15:47,047
I'm out there making
fat stacks, man. Chill.

165
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,958
Hey. Prepaid cell phone.
Use it.

166
00:15:59,932 --> 00:16:02,411
- How much is this?
- 26 big ones.

167
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:06,222
Is that all? $26,000?

168
00:16:06,435 --> 00:16:08,289
No, that's 26 hundred,

169
00:16:08,515 --> 00:16:10,907
and your share is 13,

170
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:13,817
minus 25 bucks for that phone.

171
00:16:14,532 --> 00:16:17,752
- How much meth did you sell?
- Nearly an ounce.

172
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:25,464
Last time I checked,
there were 16 ounces to a pound.

173
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:26,785
You smoked the rest?

174
00:16:26,822 --> 00:16:29,466
I've been out there
all night slinging crystal.

175
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:32,588
You think it's cake moving a pound
of meth one teenth at a time?

176
00:16:32,614 --> 00:16:34,750
Why are you selling it
in such small quanties?

177
00:16:34,756 --> 00:16:37,277
Why don't you just sell
the whole pound at once?

178
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:39,409
To who? What do I
look like, Scarface?

179
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,605
This is unacceptable.

180
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,018
I am breaking the law here.

181
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:46,516
This return is too little
for the risk.

182
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,923
I thought you'd be ready
for another pound today.

183
00:16:48,931 --> 00:16:50,701
You may know a lot
about chemistry,

184
00:16:50,704 --> 00:16:53,603
but you don't know jack
about slinging dope.

185
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:57,739
Well, I'll tell you, I know
a lack of motivation when I see it.

186
00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:02,960
You've got to be more
imaginative, you know?

187
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,741
Just think outside the box here.

188
00:17:06,103 --> 00:17:09,962
We have to move our product
in bulk, wholesale, now.

189
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:13,027
How do we do that?

190
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:17,362
- What do you mean, to a distributor?
- Yes. Yes.

191
00:17:17,382 --> 00:17:19,686
That's what we need.
We need a distributor now.

192
00:17:19,786 --> 00:17:21,683
Do you know
anyone like that?

193
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:25,087
Yeah, I mean I used to
until you killed him.

194
00:17:38,564 --> 00:17:42,478
So who took Krazy-8's place?

195
00:17:42,944 --> 00:17:44,923
Some guy named Tuco.

196
00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:47,565
A bad ass, from what I hear.

197
00:17:47,922 --> 00:17:51,356
Tuco, okay. So then
just go talk to Tuco.

198
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:52,947
Right. Like,

199
00:17:52,956 --> 00:17:55,346
"Hello, sir. Hey, I know
you don't know me,

200
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,259
"but would you be interested in
a felony quantity of methamphetamine?"

201
00:17:58,282 --> 00:18:01,527
Well, yes, but maybe with a little more
salesmanship, perhaps?

202
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,739
You just don't get it, man.
This guy's O.G.

203
00:18:03,777 --> 00:18:05,487
What does that mean?

204
00:18:05,623 --> 00:18:07,585
Jesus, look,
he's upper level, man.

205
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,969
He's not going to do business
with some dude he doesn't know.

206
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,102
You don't understand
the way it works.

207
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,213
You can't just bum rush
some high-level ice man

208
00:18:16,217 --> 00:18:18,126
and start cutting deals,
okay?

209
00:18:18,148 --> 00:18:20,150
It's risky.
You need an intro.

210
00:18:20,156 --> 00:18:22,144
You need
someone to vouch.

211
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,355
Well, who introduced you
to Krazy-8?

212
00:18:24,365 --> 00:18:27,270
Emilio. That's only because
I knew him from, like, third grade.

213
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:30,969
- We can't talk to Emilio, either...
- All right, all right.

214
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:34,473
Look, I'm telling you,
Mr. White, it's too risky.

215
00:18:35,586 --> 00:18:37,917
Okay?
I mean, we're making money.

216
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:40,894
Why can't you just be satisfied
with the way it is?

217
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:41,769
Jesus!

218
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,008
Just grow
some fucking balls!

219
00:19:25,658 --> 00:19:27,265
Wait till Monday again?

220
00:19:27,284 --> 00:19:29,413
Yes, please. Thank you.

221
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,549
Mr. White.

222
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:09,420
Thank you, Hugo.

223
00:20:34,915 --> 00:20:36,910
- Knock-knock.
- Oh, hey.

224
00:20:37,296 --> 00:20:39,814
- How are you feeling, Walt?
- Good.

225
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:43,939
Are you up
for having a visitor?

226
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:45,535
Hey, buddy.

227
00:20:47,183 --> 00:20:47,935
Hank.

228
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,933
Let me know
if you need anything.

229
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,596
- I will. Thank you, Carmen.
- No problem.

230
00:20:53,922 --> 00:20:54,899
Damn.

231
00:20:55,486 --> 00:20:57,585
That chick's got
an ass like an onion.

232
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,326
Makes me want to cry.

233
00:21:00,253 --> 00:21:03,537
So what are you doing here?

234
00:21:03,831 --> 00:21:06,737
Well, I had some questions
I wanted to run by you,

235
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,204
work-related.

236
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:11,882
- You okay? I could come back later.
- No, no, no, no. I'm fine.

237
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:13,530
Everything's fine.

238
00:21:14,236 --> 00:21:16,790
What do you mean
work-related, though?

239
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:20,819
Do you recognize that?

240
00:21:24,796 --> 00:21:25,624
No.

241
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:30,408
That was used to cook meth.

242
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:34,992
Found that on some Indian land
about 40 miles from here.

243
00:21:35,242 --> 00:21:38,285
Old label on the inside
used to say...

244
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:41,532
J.P. Wynne Chemistry Lab.

245
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:42,733
Really?

246
00:21:42,948 --> 00:21:45,741
I don't understand
how that came from here.

247
00:21:45,897 --> 00:21:49,118
I was hoping you could help me.
We found it near an abandoned car

248
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,493
belonging to one of our snitches.

249
00:21:54,235 --> 00:21:55,499
A snitch?

250
00:21:55,674 --> 00:21:58,204
Yeah, one of our
confidential informants.

251
00:21:58,304 --> 00:22:00,514
Went missing a while back.
No body yet,

252
00:22:00,523 --> 00:22:02,969
but we're pretty sure
he's, you know...

253
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:07,084
Probably chopped up in little pieces
and fed to the buzzards.

254
00:22:09,087 --> 00:22:12,910
Anyway, any respirators like that
go missing lately?

255
00:22:14,421 --> 00:22:15,868
No. No.

256
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:19,837
No, I mean,
not that I know of.

257
00:22:20,012 --> 00:22:22,242
I'll need to take a look
at that inventory.

258
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,846
Sure. I got a list
hanging on the wall.

259
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:27,354
You mind if I take a look
at your storeroom?

260
00:22:27,467 --> 00:22:30,435
Not at all, no. Be my guest.

261
00:22:34,317 --> 00:22:35,668
Right. So who's got keys?

262
00:22:36,067 --> 00:22:38,559
Well, the science faculty,
the staff,

263
00:22:38,576 --> 00:22:41,603
Carmen, the vice principal
has the master,

264
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:42,990
and me.

265
00:22:43,355 --> 00:22:45,088
How about students?

266
00:22:45,689 --> 00:22:46,695
No, no.

267
00:22:46,815 --> 00:22:48,368
No students have keys.

268
00:22:48,829 --> 00:22:50,065
I should hope not.

269
00:22:50,075 --> 00:22:53,071
My question is do any know
where you keep them?

270
00:22:53,678 --> 00:22:55,489
I don't think so. No.

271
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:58,402
Besides, I keep them right here
in my pocket anyway, so...

272
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:01,007
Walt, look, I know they're
your students, but,

273
00:23:01,331 --> 00:23:03,885
do not underestimate them.
Big mistake.

274
00:23:03,941 --> 00:23:06,064
Are there
any other respirators?

275
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,184
Uh, no.

276
00:23:07,194 --> 00:23:10,208
Because I'm counting six.
Inventory says eight.

277
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,875
Glassware looking
a little sparse.

278
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:17,434
- Is it?
- Yeah.

279
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:21,604
You're missing a couple of
Erlenmeyer flasks at least.

280
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:23,809
Oh, yeah.

281
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,995
A 5,000 milliliter
round bottom.

282
00:23:28,262 --> 00:23:31,041
Meth heads love
to brew in this, baby.

283
00:23:32,634 --> 00:23:34,080
Going to answer that?

284
00:23:34,296 --> 00:23:36,405
No, it's just...
No, I don't...

285
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,831
Maybe it's Skyler.
She's in trouble or something.

286
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:42,768
Don't ignore it on my account.
Answer it! C'mon, I got stuff to do.

287
00:23:43,128 --> 00:23:44,759
- Jeez.
- Okay.

288
00:23:46,434 --> 00:23:47,405
Hello.

289
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,495
Yo. What's up, Mr. W?

290
00:23:50,775 --> 00:23:51,953
Speaking.

291
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,552
- Bad time to talk?
- Absolutely.

292
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:56,304
All right,
so just listen.

293
00:23:56,392 --> 00:23:59,502
You know that guy
we were talking about, Tuco?

294
00:23:59,634 --> 00:24:01,557
Turns out my boy
Skinny Pete

295
00:24:01,562 --> 00:24:04,365
was in the same cellblock with him
over at Los Lunas.

296
00:24:04,404 --> 00:24:06,025
So we got our in.

297
00:24:06,126 --> 00:24:09,193
We're hauling a pound
to the dude right now.

298
00:24:09,775 --> 00:24:10,881
Okay, then.

299
00:24:10,892 --> 00:24:13,407
Thank you very much for calling.

300
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:18,996
My doctor is very solicitous.

301
00:24:19,651 --> 00:24:22,622
Look, buddy, the last thing I want to do
is get you in hot water,

302
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:25,834
but some meth monkey
had a feeding frenzy in here, okay?

303
00:24:25,939 --> 00:24:28,479
You got to keep a better
watch over your turf.

304
00:24:28,543 --> 00:24:29,733
I will.

305
00:24:30,173 --> 00:24:33,667
We don't want people
to start wondering about you, right?

306
00:24:40,588 --> 00:24:41,765
Right. No.

307
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:43,681
Right. Absolutely not.

308
00:24:47,462 --> 00:24:49,452
So you're sure you're
tight with this guy?

309
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:51,713
Two nuts in a ball sack, yo.

310
00:25:08,696 --> 00:25:10,850
Yo, man, I'm Skinny Pete!

311
00:25:19,606 --> 00:25:22,599
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea, yo. Come on.

312
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:29,234
Atta man.
That's what's happening.

313
00:25:42,694 --> 00:25:44,648
Yo, Tuco's expecting us.

314
00:25:55,084 --> 00:25:57,739
No need, man.
Me and Tuco go back.

315
00:26:11,951 --> 00:26:14,820
Tuco. What's happening,
my brother?

316
00:26:21,082 --> 00:26:22,907
Sick crib, yo.

317
00:26:22,912 --> 00:26:25,168
You been keeping it real
since you been sprung.

318
00:26:25,173 --> 00:26:27,065
What's it been,
like a year?

319
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:29,078
- This your boy?
- Yeah, Jesse.

320
00:26:29,114 --> 00:26:31,570
The dude with the glass
I was telling you about.

321
00:26:31,616 --> 00:26:34,283
Hey, man.
Yeah, I've heard a lot about you.

322
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,536
Break out the ice.

323
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:54,381
Take a bump.

324
00:26:54,388 --> 00:26:56,468
No worries, man.
I'm no cop.

325
00:26:58,226 --> 00:26:59,966
I said hit it.

326
00:27:02,835 --> 00:27:03,925
All right.

327
00:27:19,813 --> 00:27:23,460
This kicks like a mule
with his balls wrapped in duct tape.

328
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,387
- Where'd you get it?
- I cooked it.

329
00:27:29,091 --> 00:27:30,169
Bullshit!

330
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,043
Who you working for?

331
00:27:34,491 --> 00:27:37,623
No one, man. I mean,
I have a partner that I cook with,

332
00:27:37,653 --> 00:27:39,176
but that's it.

333
00:27:42,045 --> 00:27:43,241
All right.

334
00:27:46,511 --> 00:27:47,802
We got a deal.

335
00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:50,008
See? I told you
Tuco would hook you up.

336
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:50,993
Cool.

337
00:27:51,595 --> 00:27:53,398
I haven't said how much.

338
00:28:02,025 --> 00:28:04,468
All right. How much?

339
00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:07,192
35 large for the pound.

340
00:28:11,998 --> 00:28:14,528
Well, you're
a little light, ese.

341
00:28:18,265 --> 00:28:20,674
It's all right. Don't sweat it.
It's all good.

342
00:28:20,688 --> 00:28:23,246
It's good.
Walk. Get out of here.

343
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,708
- What about the money?
- You'll get it.

344
00:28:26,979 --> 00:28:29,284
This is a consignment operation.

345
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,976
You want me to float 35 G's?

346
00:28:35,608 --> 00:28:37,221
You don't trust me?

347
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:40,796
No, no. Hey, it's not that, man.
It's just, you know, I don't...

348
00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:42,718
I don't do business that way.

349
00:28:42,737 --> 00:28:45,359
Tough shit!
The deal is done!

350
00:28:47,868 --> 00:28:49,722
You said this was cool.

351
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:51,874
Get money for meth.
Cash up front.

352
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:54,919
Don't front, dude.
Tuco's good for it.

353
00:28:55,299 --> 00:28:58,237
I don't need your punk ass
to vouch for me!

354
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:03,729
Come on!

355
00:29:05,222 --> 00:29:06,537
Oh, come on!

356
00:29:18,677 --> 00:29:22,661
All right, you brought me
some really clean crystal.

357
00:29:25,574 --> 00:29:28,141
Do you really
want your money up front?

358
00:29:51,818 --> 00:29:53,183
Up front.

359
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,210
Nobody moves crystal

360
00:30:25,213 --> 00:30:27,916
in the South Valley but me, bitch!

361
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,370
Good morning, Hugo.

362
00:30:51,718 --> 00:30:54,524
Don't mind if
I call you Hugo... Hugo.

363
00:30:58,771 --> 00:31:01,326
We've never had a crowd
on the street like that.

364
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,274
Is that Uncle Hank?

365
00:31:08,649 --> 00:31:11,405
Uncle Hank's arresting
Mr. Archuleta.

366
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:15,037
This doesn't make any sense
to me at all. I don't understand.

367
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:18,716
I got two words for you:
background check. How about that?

368
00:31:20,668 --> 00:31:24,004
Yo, yo, yo. 148-3369,

369
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:25,695
representing the ABQ.

370
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,087
What up, biatch?

371
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:28,897
Leave it at the tone.

372
00:31:29,123 --> 00:31:32,384
Where the hell are you?
Call me back.

373
00:31:33,028 --> 00:31:34,846
- Hey, Walt.
- Yeah?

374
00:31:35,523 --> 00:31:37,276
Hank's about to deal.

375
00:31:37,377 --> 00:31:39,858
Okay. I'll be right there.

376
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:49,131
All right. Let's see
what the turn brings us.

377
00:31:50,522 --> 00:31:52,301
You're looking good, Walt.

378
00:31:52,367 --> 00:31:53,799
Your color's better.

379
00:31:53,814 --> 00:31:55,845
Yeah? Thanks.

380
00:31:55,983 --> 00:31:58,883
He's actually on
the pretty strong stuff now.

381
00:31:59,215 --> 00:32:02,800
Dr. Delcavoli's trying to talk him into
taking some time off from work, but...

382
00:32:02,812 --> 00:32:05,687
Well, actually, I just
talked to Carmen this morning,

383
00:32:05,725 --> 00:32:08,656
and they're getting
a substitute for a few weeks.

384
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:12,183
I just didn't have a chance
to tell you. Sorry.

385
00:32:12,346 --> 00:32:13,961
Your bet, tough guy.

386
00:32:14,254 --> 00:32:15,281
Check.

387
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,809
Yeah. Check.

388
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,885
Check's in the mail.

389
00:32:20,993 --> 00:32:22,178
10 million.

390
00:32:22,226 --> 00:32:23,956
Red's 25 million.
Blue's 10.

391
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:26,981
Then 25 million
because that's how I roll.

392
00:32:27,194 --> 00:32:30,220
Hey, Uncle Hank,
why were you arresting

393
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:32,854
Mr. Archuleta the other day?

394
00:32:33,015 --> 00:32:34,444
He's a pretty cool guy.

395
00:32:34,468 --> 00:32:37,640
Well, turns out
that he has a record.

396
00:32:37,843 --> 00:32:40,074
Yeah. Couple
of possession beefs.

397
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:44,090
We figure he was the guy that was
stealing your school's chemistry gear.

398
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,327
I mean, you know,
he had a key.

399
00:32:46,653 --> 00:32:48,168
Fit the profile.

400
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:51,781
When we searched his truck,
we found a big old fat blunt,

401
00:32:52,069 --> 00:32:55,328
which goes to prove old Huge Hugo
ain't so cool after all.

402
00:32:55,415 --> 00:32:56,812
It's to you, Walt.

403
00:32:56,862 --> 00:32:59,192
Yeah, I'll call.

404
00:32:59,772 --> 00:33:01,675
I can't believe
the school system

405
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,703
didn't know
about this guy's record.

406
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,634
I mean, that's pretty scary.

407
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:08,238
How could something like that
just slip through the cracks?

408
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,078
I don't know. I mean,
for what it's worth,

409
00:33:11,453 --> 00:33:14,346
Hugo just doesn't strike me
as the thief.

410
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,021
Yeah, well, nothing
personal, Walt, but

411
00:33:17,053 --> 00:33:20,936
you wouldn't know a criminal if he was
close enough to check you for a hernia.

412
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:25,368
Now, that said,
we got a search warrant,

413
00:33:25,377 --> 00:33:27,619
and we tore
old Hugo's house apart.

414
00:33:27,691 --> 00:33:30,271
Turns out he's
a major league pothead.

415
00:33:30,553 --> 00:33:33,448
But he didn't
raid your chemistry set.

416
00:33:33,523 --> 00:33:35,139
You hiding something?

417
00:33:41,457 --> 00:33:42,457
I'm in.

418
00:33:42,505 --> 00:33:44,836
And the river card.

419
00:33:47,381 --> 00:33:49,448
Yeah, I got nothing.
I'm out.

420
00:33:49,848 --> 00:33:50,800
I'm out.

421
00:33:54,382 --> 00:33:55,347
Yowsa!

422
00:33:56,206 --> 00:33:59,904
When old "holes in her purse" bails,
you know you're in deep.

423
00:34:00,362 --> 00:34:02,829
Looks like it's
you and me, buddy.

424
00:34:03,682 --> 00:34:05,930
What's going to happen
to him? Hugo.

425
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:09,996
Well, I mean, he's going to lose
his job, like he should.

426
00:34:10,247 --> 00:34:14,155
Probably spend a couple months
in County, as it's not his first rap.

427
00:34:15,691 --> 00:34:17,356
I'm waiting.

428
00:34:19,795 --> 00:34:22,266
You going to man up,
or you're going to puss out?

429
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:23,143
Hank.

430
00:34:24,815 --> 00:34:26,130
What? Sorry.

431
00:34:30,187 --> 00:34:31,439
I'm all in.

432
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:35,843
No.

433
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:40,807
You bad, bad, bad,
horrible liar.

434
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,229
What are you smoking
there, huh?

435
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:48,613
You got a heart?
You got the flush, don't you?

436
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,940
Nope. Not falling for it,
buddy. I fold.

437
00:34:57,832 --> 00:34:59,779
Talk about anti-climactic.

438
00:34:59,788 --> 00:35:02,410
Your cards couldn't
have been that bad.

439
00:35:02,484 --> 00:35:05,412
Oh, my God.
You threw away an ace...

440
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:08,798
- What are you doing? Don't.
- ...and a cowboy, for...

441
00:35:13,922 --> 00:35:15,801
A handful of nothing.

442
00:36:16,865 --> 00:36:18,155
Who is this?

443
00:36:18,431 --> 00:36:20,385
I was dialing Jesse Pinkman.

444
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:25,524
Well, where is he, then?

445
00:36:40,068 --> 00:36:41,358
You the guy?

446
00:36:42,213 --> 00:36:43,991
Yeah, I'm the guy.

447
00:36:49,606 --> 00:36:50,879
How is he?

448
00:36:52,122 --> 00:36:54,546
Got some busted ribs
and like that.

449
00:36:55,955 --> 00:36:58,122
Got messed up
pretty good.

450
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:01,225
I was all like
"Damn, Tuco, chill, ese."

451
00:37:03,092 --> 00:37:05,896
I don't know what got into him.
Seriously.

452
00:37:08,511 --> 00:37:11,038
Oh, he's out, man,
way out.

453
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:14,229
They got him doped up
big-time.

454
00:37:19,994 --> 00:37:22,074
So you're the cook, huh?

455
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:25,890
Yo, I didn't
catch your name.

456
00:37:39,998 --> 00:37:42,115
Tell me about this Tuco.

457
00:37:43,211 --> 00:37:45,438
Tell me everything about him.

458
00:39:28,937 --> 00:39:30,164
Good morning.

459
00:39:33,283 --> 00:39:35,249
Would you
pass the butter, please?

460
00:39:37,657 --> 00:39:39,273
Bad ass, Dad.

461
00:40:32,403 --> 00:40:33,665
You Tuco?

462
00:40:39,141 --> 00:40:42,660
I want to talk to Tuco,
and I'm not leaving until I do.

463
00:42:07,513 --> 00:42:09,010
What's your name?

464
00:42:09,807 --> 00:42:11,335
Heisenberg.

465
00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:13,100
Heisenberg.

466
00:42:14,105 --> 00:42:14,970
Okay.

467
00:42:15,778 --> 00:42:17,820
Have a seat, Heisenberg.

468
00:42:18,641 --> 00:42:21,326
I don't imagine
I'll be here very long.

469
00:42:21,447 --> 00:42:22,748
No?

470
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:25,024
All right.

471
00:42:27,017 --> 00:42:28,294
Be that way.

472
00:42:30,873 --> 00:42:32,515
It's your meeting.

473
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:36,041
Why don't you start talking
and tell me what you want?

474
00:42:37,045 --> 00:42:38,511
$50,000.

475
00:42:40,814 --> 00:42:43,256
Oh, man! 50 G's?

476
00:42:43,635 --> 00:42:44,980
How you figure that?

477
00:42:44,985 --> 00:42:47,456
35 for the pound
of meth you stole

478
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:50,812
and another 15 for my partner's
pain and suffering.

479
00:42:56,387 --> 00:42:57,364
Partner.

480
00:43:04,628 --> 00:43:07,909
Oh, yeah. I remember
that little bitch.

481
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:10,930
So you must be Daddy.

482
00:43:19,562 --> 00:43:21,378
Let me get this straight.

483
00:43:23,246 --> 00:43:25,651
I steal your dope, hmm?

484
00:43:26,351 --> 00:43:30,233
I beat the piss
out of your mule boy!

485
00:43:31,032 --> 00:43:34,966
And then you walk in here,
and you bring me more meth?

486
00:43:38,863 --> 00:43:41,139
That's a brilliant plan, ese.

487
00:43:41,265 --> 00:43:42,329
Brilliant.

488
00:43:44,052 --> 00:43:46,331
You got one part
of that wrong.

489
00:43:50,897 --> 00:43:53,353
This is not meth.

490
00:44:21,063 --> 00:44:22,516
Are you nuts?

491
00:44:22,731 --> 00:44:24,446
You want to find out?

492
00:44:25,149 --> 00:44:27,413
No-Doze, Gonzo, calma!

493
00:44:27,772 --> 00:44:29,620
Calma. Calma.

494
00:44:32,251 --> 00:44:33,881
You got balls.

495
00:44:34,215 --> 00:44:35,744
I'll give you that.

496
00:44:35,869 --> 00:44:37,418
All right. All right.

497
00:44:37,643 --> 00:44:39,472
I'll give you your money.

498
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,403
That crystal that your
partner brought me,

499
00:44:48,378 --> 00:44:50,338
it sold faster

500
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,001
than $10 ass in TJ.

501
00:44:56,978 --> 00:44:58,807
What say you bring me

502
00:44:59,208 --> 00:45:01,075
another pound next week?

503
00:45:04,289 --> 00:45:05,871
Money up front.

504
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,219
All right.

505
00:45:08,738 --> 00:45:10,340
Money up front.

506
00:45:14,933 --> 00:45:18,001
Sometimes you got to rob
to keep your riches.

507
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:22,518
Just as long as we
got an understanding.

508
00:45:25,379 --> 00:45:27,606
One pound
is not going to cut it.

509
00:45:27,847 --> 00:45:29,654
You have to take two.

510
00:45:36,262 --> 00:45:37,414
Orale.

511
00:45:40,548 --> 00:45:41,913
What is that shit?

512
00:45:43,923 --> 00:45:45,889
Fulminated mercury.

513
00:45:47,226 --> 00:45:49,531
A little tweak of chemistry.

No, now listen, I, uh--

00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,355
This attack
on my brother-in-law,

00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:08,491
I don't-- I don't know
what it means.

I'm sure they'll be fine.

is gravely injured.

It's doubtful he'll live.

12
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:26,640
Now thank me and shake my hand.

13
00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:31,649
Uh, thank you.
Thank you again.

Your nephews grew impatient.

30
00:01:36,857 --> 00:01:38,224
They continue to press me

31
00:01:38,258 --> 00:01:40,526
for my permission
to kill Walter White.

32

When I wouldn't give it,

33
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,964
they settled instead
for DEA agent Schrader.

34
00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:50,002
Their phone call was
placed to Agent Schrader

00:01:50,037 --> 00:01:51,370
moments before the attack,

36
00:01:51,404 --> 00:01:54,040
thus giving him the upper hand.

and in the confusion,
Juan was shot dead.

44
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:19,301
An accident, perhaps.

45
00:02:19,335 --> 00:02:23,405

to hear a progress report

00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,738
So call me.

69
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:41,345
Anyway, so for me, that's been
the biggest wake-up call--

70
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,382
letting go, giving up control.

71
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,950
It's like they say--

72
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,620
you know, man plans,
and God laughs.

73
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:53,559
That is such bullshit.

74
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,327
Excuse me?

75
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:58,698
Never give up control.

76
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:02,435
Live life on your own terms.

77
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,638
Yeah. No. I get
what you're saying.

78
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:07,908
But-- But, uh,

Oh, to hell with your cancer.

80
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:13,045
I've been living with cancer
for the better part of a year.

81
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,247
Right from the start,
it's a death sentence.

82
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,048
It's what they keep telling me.

83
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,950
Well, guess what.

84
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:22,520
Every life comes
with a death sentence.

85
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:27,058
So every few months, I come
in here for my regular scan,

86
00:05:27,092 --> 00:05:30,995
knowing full well
that one of these times--

87
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:33,130
hell, maybe even today--

88
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,501
I'm going to hear some bad news.

89
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:42,040
But until then, who's in charge?

90
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,308

00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,614
That's how I live my life.

92

from the tap, remember?

95
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:13,575
Yeah.

Ah, yes, indeed.

How was your meal?

107
00:07:02,191 --> 00:07:03,625
Agent Schrader and I had a chance

108
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:06,094
to catch up in one of my restaurants
a few days ago.

109
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:07,362
I'd eat there every day,

110
00:07:07,397 --> 00:07:08,730
but I wouldn't
fit through the door.

111
00:07:08,765 --> 00:07:10,966
Well, should we get started?
Yeah.

112
00:07:12,402 --> 00:07:14,436
I'd like to record
this conversation,

113
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,038
if that's okay.
Of course.

114
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:24,413
The DEA is working
on an investigation

115
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:26,115
which may overlap with my own,

116
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:28,183
so I've asked them
to sit in with us today.

117
00:07:28,218 --> 00:07:29,551
Gus, we all appreciate

118
00:07:29,585 --> 00:07:31,420
your coming in here
to talk to us,

119
00:07:31,454 --> 00:07:34,523
but you have the right to have
an attorney present also.

120
00:07:34,558 --> 00:07:37,927
Oh, well, I can't see how
that would be necessary.

121
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:40,162
But then again I have
no idea why I'm here.

122
00:07:40,196 --> 00:07:41,797
So you wish to continue?

123
00:07:41,831 --> 00:07:43,899
Please.
I'm very anxious

124
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:46,969
to find out what this
is all about.

125
00:07:47,003 --> 00:07:50,739
Sir, your fingerprints
were found at a crime scene.

126
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:52,274
Really?

127
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:54,076
That's surprising.

128
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,046
A drug-related homicide.

129
00:08:02,353 --> 00:08:04,555
Gale Boetticher's apartment.

130
00:08:09,262 --> 00:08:11,096
So you knew the victim.

131
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:20,273
15 years ago, I established
a chemistry scholarship at UNM.

132
00:08:20,307 --> 00:08:23,443
I named it after
Maximino Arsiniega,

133
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:25,679
a dear friend of mine
who died too young.

134
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,415
Gale was a recipient
of this scholarship.

135
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:32,819
He was, uh, perhaps
one of three dozen.

136
00:08:32,853 --> 00:08:34,954
I see.

137
00:08:34,988 --> 00:08:39,258
And Mr. Boetticher
graduated in...

138
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:41,527
1999.

139
00:08:41,561 --> 00:08:42,695
That sounds right.

140
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:44,596
And you kept in regular
contact with him

141
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,763
over all this time?

142
00:08:45,798 --> 00:08:47,432
Oh, no. I hadn't
seen Gale for years

143
00:08:47,466 --> 00:08:50,134
until I ran into him
a few weeks ago.

144
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:51,636
Ran into him where?

145
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,038
At the restaurant.

146
00:08:53,072 --> 00:08:57,008
Uh, well, "ran into"
isn't quite accurate,

147
00:08:57,043 --> 00:08:58,276
as I assume he came by

148
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,777
to re-establish
contact with me.

149
00:08:59,812 --> 00:09:02,313
We caught up briefly.

150
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:03,647
He invited me to dinner
the following night,

151
00:09:03,682 --> 00:09:05,082
and I accepted.

152
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:09,721
It was, uh, perhaps a week later

153
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:11,089
I read about him in the paper.

154
00:09:11,124 --> 00:09:12,224
Drug related, you said?

155
00:09:12,258 --> 00:09:14,660
[Asac]
It's a good possibility.

156
00:09:14,694 --> 00:09:16,562
The paper made
no mention of that.

157
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:20,166
I assumed that it was
a random crime.

158
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:21,468
So after years with no contact,

159
00:09:21,502 --> 00:09:23,504
he shows up in your restaurant,

160
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:25,673
remakes your acquaintance,

161
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:26,741
and invites you to dinner?

162
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:27,842
Yeah, he wanted money.

163
00:09:27,877 --> 00:09:29,110
Gale Boetticher
asked you for money?

164
00:09:29,145 --> 00:09:31,079
He didn't come right
out and say that.

165
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,380
He spoke in terms

166
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,617
of a vague investment
opportunity,

167
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:37,452
but it was my suspicion, yes,

168
00:09:37,486 --> 00:09:39,754
as to why he invited me
into his home.

169
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,857
He was a very talented chemist,

170
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:45,193
but for reasons
I never understood,

171
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:48,629
he was more interested
in taking shortcuts

172
00:09:48,664 --> 00:09:50,798
than what would
or could have been

173
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,500
a very promising career.

174
00:09:52,534 --> 00:09:54,968
But personal shortcomings
notwithstanding,

175
00:09:55,003 --> 00:09:57,303
he was a warm, gentle person,

176
00:09:57,338 --> 00:09:59,806
and I thought a lot of him.

177
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:04,376
At any rate, I, uh,

178
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,044
declined his business offer,

179
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,514
and, after what was
a very pleasant meal, left.

180
00:10:09,548 --> 00:10:12,017
Can you tell us where you were

181
00:10:12,051 --> 00:10:14,419
on the night of Wednesday
the 23rd

182
00:10:14,453 --> 00:10:15,687
at around 8 p.m.?

183
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:17,823
Not an accusation,
just a question.

184
00:10:17,857 --> 00:10:20,125
Oh, I understand.
Let's see.

185
00:10:22,828 --> 00:10:24,362
23rd.

186
00:10:24,397 --> 00:10:25,697
Ah.

187
00:10:25,732 --> 00:10:28,401
I was at a fundraiser
at Presbyterian Hospital.

188
00:10:28,435 --> 00:10:30,836
I was there from 7 to about 10.

189
00:10:35,442 --> 00:10:36,843
Anyone else?

190
00:10:40,248 --> 00:10:41,415
Uh, sorry, yeah.

191
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,384
Just, uh, just one other thing.

192
00:10:43,418 --> 00:10:46,488
Uh, is Gustavo Fring
your real name?

193
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,092
Is it my real name?

194
00:10:50,126 --> 00:10:53,729
I know you're a Chilean national,

195
00:10:53,763 --> 00:10:57,733
but there are no records
of you ever living there.

196
00:10:57,767 --> 00:11:00,001
Really?

197
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:01,536
I mean, records show

198
00:11:01,571 --> 00:11:05,440
that you immigrated
to Mexico in 1986,

199
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:06,908
and then,
a couple of years later,

200
00:11:06,942 --> 00:11:09,577
you were granted an entry visa
to the United States.

201
00:11:09,612 --> 00:11:12,480
But there's no record
of Gustavo Fring

202
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:15,784
ever having existed in Chile,

203
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:19,021
which I find--
I don't know-- uh, strange.

204
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:21,590
Well, really, it isn't.

205
00:11:21,624 --> 00:11:24,226
General Pinochet's
government was guilty

206
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,460
of a great many sins.

207
00:11:25,494 --> 00:11:27,395
First and foremost were
his human rights abuses.

208
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,399
But it was also
notoriously unreliable

209
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:31,466
at keeping records.

210
00:11:32,768 --> 00:11:35,203
I'm sure, if you keep
digging, you'll find me.

211
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,542
Okay.
I think that's it, Gus.

212
00:11:40,577 --> 00:11:41,644
Uh, thank you.

213
00:11:41,678 --> 00:11:44,047
I hope that I was
of some small help.

214
00:11:44,081 --> 00:11:46,482
You were, absolutely.
Thank you.

215
00:11:46,516 --> 00:11:47,516
You're very welcome.

216
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:49,484
Good to see you again.

217
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,119
Oh, no. No, please, please.
Thank you.

218
00:11:51,154 --> 00:11:52,154
Thanks.

219
00:11:57,393 --> 00:11:58,459
Gentlemen.

220
00:12:21,363 --> 00:12:23,627
So.. Are we buying?

221
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:25,201
This thing with his name--

222
00:12:25,235 --> 00:12:26,435
what are you thinking there?

223
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,105
Sure, the record keeping
in South America

224
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,206
is hit or miss.

225
00:12:30,241 --> 00:12:32,309
I mean, we run into that
all the time, right?

226
00:12:32,343 --> 00:12:34,111
We usually find something.

227
00:12:34,146 --> 00:12:37,214
I mean, before '86,
this guy's a ghost.

228
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:39,116
If the State Department
wasn't satisfied with his records,

229
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,317
they wouldn't have
naturalized him.

230
00:12:40,351 --> 00:12:41,552
Well, maybe,

231
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:44,021
but he immigrated
from Mexico in '89.

232
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:46,658
You know, the state just wasn't
as tough on background checks

233
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:47,825
pre-9/11.

234
00:12:47,859 --> 00:12:49,794
Regardless, I don't know
what this has to do

235
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:50,928
with the case at hand.

236
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:52,330
I was definitely curious

237
00:12:52,364 --> 00:12:54,899
when his prints show up
at Boetticher's apartment,

238
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:57,335
but for me, the scholarship
thing explains it.

239
00:12:57,369 --> 00:12:59,704
Well, I'll admit
to a certain degree of bias.

240
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:03,040
This man has been
a longtime friend of DEA,

241
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,976
but that being said, uh...

242
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:07,845
I thought his story was credible.

243
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:10,681
Well, I agree. I think
it was a good story.

244
00:13:10,715 --> 00:13:13,150
Still, why are we hearing it now?

245
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:14,285
What do you mean?

246
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:16,087
Well,
like you said, he's a--

247
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:19,256
this man's a big
law enforcement booster.

248
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,125
One day he's reading a newspaper

249
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:23,427
and sees that somebody
he just had dinner with,

250
00:13:23,462 --> 00:13:26,030
somebody he thought
a lot of, was murdered.

251
00:13:26,064 --> 00:13:29,300
He reads this, and he
doesn't make a phone call?

252
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:32,870
Doesn't call you or one
of his other cop friends

253
00:13:32,904 --> 00:13:35,740
to share his connection
with the case

254
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,841
or ask about the investigation.

255
00:13:37,876 --> 00:13:40,277
We can't predicate
a criminal investigation

256
00:13:40,311 --> 00:13:44,213
on a person
not making phone calls.

257
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,816
What do you think, Tim?

258
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:51,086
Well, I want to follow up
on the scholarship, the alibi.

259
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,455
But my overall impression?
I believed him.

260
00:14:04,566 --> 00:14:07,535
Nice touch. Bird bath.

261
00:14:09,338 --> 00:14:11,004
Hey, tiger.
How's it hanging?

262
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,172
Good.

263
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:17,111
Yeah. So, very nice.

264
00:14:17,145 --> 00:14:19,680
What's the damage?

265
00:14:19,714 --> 00:14:21,182
1,200 a month.

266
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:23,050
I did a lot of researching
for this neighborhood.

267
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:24,418
It's a pretty good deal.

268
00:14:24,453 --> 00:14:26,554
You kidding me?
That's a great deal.

269
00:14:26,588 --> 00:14:29,090
Uh, speaking of which, ahem.

270
00:14:29,124 --> 00:14:31,292
That's for the week,

271
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:32,827
plus there's a little
extra in there

272
00:14:32,861 --> 00:14:35,129
for any move-related
incidentals.

273
00:14:35,164 --> 00:14:36,330
Thank you.

274
00:14:36,365 --> 00:14:39,066
Hey, champ, how's the new school?

275
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:40,768
Good.

276
00:14:40,802 --> 00:14:42,437
I loved school
when I was your age.

277
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:44,305
Seesaws, story time,

278
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,873
chasing girls with sticks.

279
00:14:45,908 --> 00:14:47,208
Ha ha ha ha!

280
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:57,918
It wasn't until the fifth grade

281
00:14:57,953 --> 00:15:00,355
that I found out
she liked me, too.

282
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:03,191
But by then her family
had moved to Scottsdale,

283
00:15:03,225 --> 00:15:04,292
so...

284
00:15:06,628 --> 00:15:08,429
<i>carpe diem,</i> okay?

285
00:15:08,464 --> 00:15:09,464
Okay.

286
00:15:09,498 --> 00:15:11,899
All right, good boy.
Ha!

287
00:15:11,934 --> 00:15:15,369
So, um, you'll thank Jesse
again from both of us.

288
00:15:15,404 --> 00:15:16,537
You got it.

289
00:15:17,906 --> 00:15:20,708
So is he-- How's he doing?

290
00:15:20,742 --> 00:15:21,775
Jesse?

291
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:28,383
He's good.

292
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:32,086
He's, uh... he's busy.

293
00:15:40,428 --> 00:15:41,528
How is it?

294
00:15:41,563 --> 00:15:43,530
Oh, there's space, lots of light.

295
00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:46,300
It's-- A little garden out back.
It's nice.

296
00:15:47,535 --> 00:15:51,405
And Brock? How's he doing?

297
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:54,375
Hey, look, I don't mind
dropping checks off

298
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:56,644
every week like Ed McMahon.

299
00:15:56,678 --> 00:15:59,312
But if you really want
to know how they're doing,

300
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:01,681
why don't you go
see for yourself?

301
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:08,521
I'll catch you later.

302
00:16:09,757 --> 00:16:11,491
Hey, you going to need
a ride home?

303
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:12,525
No.

304
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,163
[gasp]

305
00:16:57,936 --> 00:16:59,203
Great.

306
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:06,012
[Skyler] Anyway, I'm proud
for not losing my cool.

307
00:17:06,046 --> 00:17:07,780
Plus it shows
our wipe-down crew

308
00:17:07,814 --> 00:17:09,215
that I will support them

309
00:17:09,249 --> 00:17:11,417
if a customer is being
really rude to them.

310
00:17:11,452 --> 00:17:14,921
You're really taking
to this whole be your own boss thing.

311
00:17:14,956 --> 00:17:18,625
Yeah. I guess I am.

312
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:21,061
Actually,

313
00:17:21,095 --> 00:17:24,464
I'm thinking about making
a move up to management.

314
00:17:24,498 --> 00:17:25,865
Mmm.
Ah, Jesus.

315
00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:27,166
Corporate America, look out.

316
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:28,401
Oh, excuse me.

317
00:17:28,435 --> 00:17:30,235
I would be a vast improvement.

318
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,237
No one in Kleinman's
entire front office

319
00:17:32,272 --> 00:17:34,773
knows the first thing
about giving an X-ray,

320
00:17:34,807 --> 00:17:36,775
which just-- ahh.

321
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:39,144
Hey, Dad, uh, whatever
happened with your scan?

322
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:41,414
Did-- Did you get
the results back?

323
00:17:41,448 --> 00:17:45,752
Yeah. I did.

324
00:17:45,786 --> 00:17:48,188
And I'm still in remission.

325
00:17:48,223 --> 00:17:52,193
So you're all going to have
to be stuck with me

326
00:17:52,227 --> 00:17:53,261
for a while longer.

327
00:17:53,295 --> 00:17:54,729
Cheers, buddy.

328
00:17:56,365 --> 00:17:57,732
What about you, Hank?

329
00:17:57,766 --> 00:17:59,233
How you feeling these days?

330
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:01,402
Well, I'm getting there.

331
00:18:01,436 --> 00:18:03,403
The other day,
he had a big powwow

332
00:18:03,438 --> 00:18:06,406
with all the DEA
muckity-mucks.

333
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,808
What was that about?

334
00:18:08,843 --> 00:18:11,978
Nothing. Just a dead end.

335
00:18:12,012 --> 00:18:14,146
He won't tell me, either.

336
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:16,282
Apparently,
it's all very hush-hush.

337
00:18:17,384 --> 00:18:19,819
Hey, Walt, can you do me a favor?

338
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:22,822
Uh, Marie's working tomorrow,

339
00:18:22,856 --> 00:18:24,791
and there's this gem
and mineral show

340
00:18:24,825 --> 00:18:25,959
that's opening
at the fairgrounds.

341
00:18:25,994 --> 00:18:29,663
I wondered if you can
maybe give me a lift.

342
00:18:29,697 --> 00:18:32,734
Yeah. Sure.

343
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:35,403
I had a collection of my own
back in high school.

344
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:36,438
I mean, nothing fancy.

345
00:18:36,472 --> 00:18:39,340
Just entry-level
beryls and garnets,

346
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:42,076
one passable black tourmaline.

347
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,844
Turn right here.
Okay.

348
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:47,881
But I did have one piece
of morganite

349
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,150
that was very special.

350
00:18:50,185 --> 00:18:52,319
It had been heat treated,

351
00:18:52,354 --> 00:18:54,588
so it had that classic
cast to it,

352
00:18:54,622 --> 00:18:58,892
that rose, almost salmon
hue, you know?

353
00:18:58,926 --> 00:19:01,328
Hey, Walt,
there's no rock show, okay?

354
00:19:01,362 --> 00:19:03,663
I just said that
so Marie wouldn't freak.

355
00:19:03,698 --> 00:19:05,865
Take a right here.

356
00:19:09,403 --> 00:19:12,372
Freak about what?

357
00:19:13,474 --> 00:19:15,474
Hank, where are we going?

358
00:19:20,414 --> 00:19:21,914
You hungry?

359
00:19:24,284 --> 00:19:26,152
We're not here for the chicken.

360
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:28,254
Kill the engine.

361
00:19:32,091 --> 00:19:34,193
All right, heh heh heh.

362
00:19:34,227 --> 00:19:37,129
You ready for your mind
to be blown?

363
00:19:37,163 --> 00:19:39,331
Uh, sure.

364
00:19:39,365 --> 00:19:41,801
Gustavo Fring.

365
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:43,569
Remember him?

366
00:19:43,604 --> 00:19:45,705
He came down to the hospital
after the shooting

367
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,107
and put up the reward?

368
00:19:47,141 --> 00:19:50,744
He-- He-- He sponsors
the DEA Fun Run every year.

369
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:52,146
You-- You've met him.

370
00:19:52,181 --> 00:19:53,548
Yeah, the--
the Fun Run guy.

371
00:19:53,582 --> 00:19:55,050
Yeah, that-- that guy--

372
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:57,152
Yeah. What about him?

373
00:19:57,186 --> 00:19:58,854
Well, I suspect--

374
00:19:58,888 --> 00:20:00,322
and I can't prove it, mind you,

375
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:02,691
but I suspect...

376
00:20:02,725 --> 00:20:05,093
the man's a drug dealer.

377
00:20:05,127 --> 00:20:07,662
Hmm.

378
00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:10,465
Yeah. Methamphetamine.

379
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:13,901
I mean, honest to God,
I really believe

380
00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:16,403
that this guy's maybe
one of the biggest movers

381
00:20:16,438 --> 00:20:17,705
in the southwest.

382
00:20:17,739 --> 00:20:19,206
Remember Gale Boetticher?

383
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,542
The, uh, that sad sack
from the karaoke video tape?

384
00:20:21,576 --> 00:20:22,643
Yeah.

385
00:20:22,677 --> 00:20:24,645
And you said
that he didn't strike you

386
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,080
as being the boss-man type,

387
00:20:26,115 --> 00:20:27,749
that probably there was
a much bigger guy

388
00:20:27,783 --> 00:20:28,883
out there, right?

389
00:20:28,918 --> 00:20:29,985
Hank, that was--

390
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:31,052
that was just speculation.

391
00:20:31,087 --> 00:20:32,721
Doesn't matter.
It made me keep at it.

392
00:20:32,755 --> 00:20:34,823
And guess what I find.

393
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:39,962
Chicken man's fingerprints
at Boetticher's murder scene.

394
00:20:39,996 --> 00:20:41,430
So we bring him in--

395
00:20:41,464 --> 00:20:43,898
You think that--
that Gustavo Fring

396
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:45,633
killed Gale Boetticher?

397
00:20:45,668 --> 00:20:47,268
Well, probably not.

398
00:20:47,303 --> 00:20:48,736
I mean, these guys use, you know,

399
00:20:48,771 --> 00:20:50,405
like, a dunce
to pull the trigger, right?

400
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:51,472
But his fingerprints being there

401
00:20:51,507 --> 00:20:53,141
was enough for us
to bring him in.

402
00:20:53,175 --> 00:20:55,710
So I--
So you brought him in to the police?

403
00:20:55,744 --> 00:20:58,812
Right. He sits down
to talk with us.

404
00:20:58,847 --> 00:21:00,247
The problem is that he--

405
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:02,583
What did you ask him?
What did he say?

406
00:21:02,617 --> 00:21:04,184
Walt, will you let me
finish my story here?

407
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:07,922
Sorry. I'm just,
uh, interested.

408
00:21:07,957 --> 00:21:09,657
You know.
Yeah, all right.

409
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:10,859
So we bring him in,

410
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:14,429
and he proceeds
to kick our asses, okay?

411
00:21:14,463 --> 00:21:16,865
He's got an explanation
for the fingerprints, right?

412
00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:19,267
He's got an alibi
for Gale's murder.

413
00:21:19,302 --> 00:21:21,070
I mean, he's got reasons
for everything.

414
00:21:21,104 --> 00:21:23,873
This guy is <i>Terms of Endearment</i>
convincing.

415
00:21:25,642 --> 00:21:26,943
So he's not guilty?

416
00:21:26,977 --> 00:21:29,145
Well, as far as DEA
and APD are concerned,

417
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:35,119
he's not. Officially,
Fring's not a suspect.

418
00:21:35,153 --> 00:21:39,189
Something deep down
says he's my guy.

419
00:21:39,223 --> 00:21:40,857
Just got to prove it.

420
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,895
Hank, why-- why are you
telling me this?

421
00:21:49,565 --> 00:21:50,999
I need a favor.

422
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:53,868
What favor?

423
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:57,839
See that Volvo station wagon
over there?

424
00:21:59,175 --> 00:22:01,443
I mean, the guy drives
a 10-year-old Volvo.

425
00:22:01,478 --> 00:22:03,679
It's brilliant.
Anyway, listen.

426
00:22:04,815 --> 00:22:07,317
What I need for you to do...

427
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,188
stick this on it.

428
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:15,994
GPS tracker.

429
00:22:16,028 --> 00:22:18,863
You know, wifey thinks
hubby's screwing around on her,

430
00:22:18,898 --> 00:22:20,698
but she wants to be sure.
Hmm.

431
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:21,966
You stick this on the car.

432
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:24,135
This part right here?
It's a magnet.

433
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:25,970
And see where he goes.

434
00:22:26,004 --> 00:22:27,237
Cool, huh?

435
00:22:27,272 --> 00:22:29,573
289 from SkyMall.

436
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,742
Unfortunately, it's not live use,

437
00:22:32,776 --> 00:22:34,611
so we got to come back later
and, you know,

438
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,579
take it off and stick it
in the computer.

439
00:22:36,613 --> 00:22:39,682
Still, pretty amazing times
we live in here.

440
00:22:39,716 --> 00:22:41,317
Hank, isn't that illegal?

441
00:22:41,352 --> 00:22:44,888
I mean, isn't there some
sort of unlawful search and--

442
00:22:44,922 --> 00:22:47,725
That's, uh,
known as extra-legal,

443
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:50,828
but trust me.
It's our little secret.

444
00:22:52,364 --> 00:22:56,067
Look, it's easy, okay?
Here's what you do.

445
00:22:56,101 --> 00:22:57,969
You untie your shoelace,

446
00:22:58,003 --> 00:22:59,671
then you head
toward the restaurant.

447
00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:01,673
As you're walking past the car,

448
00:23:01,707 --> 00:23:03,842
you look down-- "Oh, hey,
darn, my shoe's untied."

449
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:04,876
Okay?

450
00:23:04,911 --> 00:23:05,978
Now, when you--
when you--

451
00:23:06,012 --> 00:23:08,079
when you bend down
to tie your shoe,

452
00:23:08,114 --> 00:23:10,382
you, uh, you stick this
up into the wheel well.

453
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:12,050
Then you go inside and,
I don't know--

454
00:23:12,085 --> 00:23:13,218
Hank, I-- I don't--

455
00:23:13,253 --> 00:23:14,887
I don't feel good
about this at all.

456
00:23:14,921 --> 00:23:16,923
Look, Walt, I-- I-- I know

457
00:23:16,957 --> 00:23:18,991
that this sort of thing
is outside your comfort zone--

458
00:23:19,026 --> 00:23:21,561
No.
I mean this is a mistake.

459
00:23:21,595 --> 00:23:24,463
Walt, I need you
to help me out here, okay?

460
00:23:24,497 --> 00:23:26,132
I mean, this is really
important to me.

461
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,667
Jesus, just--
You make me beg you?

462
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:28,968
Come on, just stick it in there.

463
00:23:37,212 --> 00:23:38,445
Yeah.

464
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,681
Just act normal.

465
00:24:23,894 --> 00:24:25,361
May I help you?

466
00:24:29,033 --> 00:24:30,634
I-- I--

467
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,703
Sir, may I help you?

468
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,539
Look, I--

469
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,610
I didn't do it.

470
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,947
See? I didn't do it.

471
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,482
Do it.

472
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:48,654
Do it.

473
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:51,490
May I help you with your order?

474
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,760
I, uh--

475
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,375
What the hell is he--

476
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:22,418
Just, uh, made sure
it was secure.

477
00:25:22,453 --> 00:25:23,486
Uh.

478
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,488
Where's my soda?

479
00:25:27,725 --> 00:25:28,891
Just kidding.

480
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:30,593
Let's-- Let's go.

481
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:04,236
Look, I--

482
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:06,542
I swear to God I thought
I was driving the man

483
00:26:06,662 --> 00:26:07,996
to a gem and mineral show.

484
00:26:08,189 --> 00:26:10,452
And all of a sudden he has me
pulling into your restaurant

485
00:26:10,507 --> 00:26:14,227
and-- and-- and telling me
that he's investigating you.

486
00:26:14,262 --> 00:26:17,764
Look, you and I,
we've had our differences,

487
00:26:17,798 --> 00:26:18,999
but I would never--

488
00:26:23,004 --> 00:26:25,406
Look, m-my brother-in-law,

489
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,209
evidence-wise, has nothing.

490
00:26:28,244 --> 00:26:30,612
He's-- He's operating
on pure conjecture,

491
00:26:30,646 --> 00:26:33,749
and no one-- not one person
that he works with--

492
00:26:33,784 --> 00:26:35,485
thinks that you are anyone

493
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:38,555
other than an owner
of a fast food chain.

494
00:26:38,589 --> 00:26:40,957
But if something
were to happen to Hank,

495
00:26:40,991 --> 00:26:43,626
then that would only draw
their attention to you

496
00:26:43,661 --> 00:26:45,862
and therefore to me as well.

497
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,764
So we have a mutual interest

498
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:50,468
in resolving this
without violence.

499
00:26:50,502 --> 00:26:55,939
I will make sure
that he discovers nothing.

500
00:27:03,113 --> 00:27:06,048
[ringing]

501
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,049
Jesse!

502
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,551
What?

503
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,786
All right. Don't wait
to be, like, invited.

504
00:27:12,956 --> 00:27:14,289
Are we alone?

505
00:27:17,727 --> 00:27:19,394
So where do we stand?

506
00:27:19,428 --> 00:27:20,929
Where do we stand on what?

507
00:27:20,963 --> 00:27:22,631
Where do we stand with the thing?

508
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:24,867
The thing that you were
supposed to do.

509
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:26,635
I assume you haven't done it.

510
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,371
You didn't lose it, did you?

511
00:27:29,405 --> 00:27:31,373
You would tell me
if you lost it, right?

512
00:27:31,407 --> 00:27:32,741
Oh, Jesus.

513
00:27:33,743 --> 00:27:35,211
Asshole.

514
00:27:35,245 --> 00:27:37,680
You creaming to get it done?
Go do it yourself.

515
00:27:37,715 --> 00:27:38,948
If he didn't see me coming

516
00:27:38,983 --> 00:27:41,084
like
he's some kind of--

517
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:42,752
This-- All right, look.

518
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:44,854
Our timetable has advanced.

519
00:27:44,888 --> 00:27:47,890
You have got to make
this meeting happen

520
00:27:47,924 --> 00:27:50,994
this week, tomorrow--
tonight, if possible.

521
00:27:51,028 --> 00:27:53,863
Oh. Tonight. Wow.

522
00:27:53,898 --> 00:27:55,532
What are you, high?

523
00:27:55,566 --> 00:27:56,833
My brother-in-law--

524
00:27:56,868 --> 00:28:00,037
My DEA agent
brother-in-law--

525
00:28:00,071 --> 00:28:02,240
He's on to Gus.

526
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,010
Huh.

527
00:28:08,347 --> 00:28:10,281
Did you hear what I just said?

528
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:12,183
My brother-in-law
is on to Gus.

529
00:28:12,217 --> 00:28:13,417
Ah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

530
00:28:13,452 --> 00:28:15,786
Your brother-in-law, okay?
I'm thinking.

531
00:28:19,557 --> 00:28:26,062
Look, uh, so what if this
is like math or algebra?

532
00:28:26,096 --> 00:28:30,566
You add a plus douche bag
to a minus douche bag

533
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,268
and you get, like,
zero douche bags.

534
00:28:34,437 --> 00:28:36,471
I've got some math for you.

535
00:28:36,505 --> 00:28:40,442
Hank catching Gus
equals Hank catching us.

536
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,978
Hank--
Geez.

537
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,679
He's relentless, all right?

538
00:28:44,714 --> 00:28:46,181
He won't quit.

539
00:28:46,215 --> 00:28:48,483
Yeah, well, he's got nothing

540
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,484
is all I can say.

541
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,953
Oh, and how would you know that?

542
00:28:50,987 --> 00:28:52,921
Because he's still above ground.

543
00:28:52,955 --> 00:28:55,891
You think a dude like Gus
would let your boy

544
00:28:55,925 --> 00:28:57,726
anywhere near him?

545
00:28:57,761 --> 00:29:00,930
He'll break out his box cutter
on his sorry gimp ass.

546
00:29:00,964 --> 00:29:04,366
So you haven't even seen him

547
00:29:04,401 --> 00:29:06,268
since that time at the diner.

548
00:29:11,475 --> 00:29:13,476
Okay. Shh.

549
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,113
Think. All right.

550
00:29:22,018 --> 00:29:25,354
Um, they've got to be
figuring that we've talked,

551
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:28,257
so you need to tell Mike

552
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:31,094
that you are worried
about Hank's investigation.

553
00:29:31,128 --> 00:29:34,431
Okay? Hank already knows
who you are, by the way.

554
00:29:34,465 --> 00:29:38,335
And besides, you actually
did kill Gale,

555
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:39,703
so there's that.

556
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:41,638
This is all good fodder

557
00:29:41,672 --> 00:29:43,840
for you to request
a sit-down with Gus

558
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:45,508
so you can discuss
what you would say

559
00:29:45,543 --> 00:29:47,711
in case Hank brings you
in for questioning.

560
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:49,046
Okay? Now you just--

561
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,014
you just say
that you want to be--

562
00:29:51,049 --> 00:29:52,816
no, that--
that you need

563
00:29:52,851 --> 00:29:54,918
to be able to be
properly coached,

564
00:29:54,953 --> 00:29:56,153
and when you're near him--

565
00:29:57,455 --> 00:29:58,956
you put this to use.

566
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:01,158
He's just going to tell me

567
00:30:01,192 --> 00:30:03,327
to shut my mouth if I get busted.

568
00:30:03,362 --> 00:30:05,096
He ain't going to set up
no meeting.

569
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,365
Well, then insist on it, damn it!

570
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:09,400
Act panicked.

571
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:11,469
Gus' ass is on the line,

572
00:30:11,503 --> 00:30:13,137
And trust me.
He will meet with you

573
00:30:13,172 --> 00:30:14,605
if he thinks
that you're a liability.

574
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,876
No, he will waste me
if he thinks I'm a liability.

575
00:30:18,911 --> 00:30:21,979
You know what? Whatever, man.

576
00:30:22,014 --> 00:30:23,647
I'm going to take a piss.

577
00:31:02,183 --> 00:31:03,217
[door closes]

578
00:31:11,194 --> 00:31:15,565
Uh, I think you got a phone call.

579
00:31:23,272 --> 00:31:24,706
Anything important?

580
00:31:47,561 --> 00:31:49,429
[phone buzzes]

581
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:56,036
Yes?

582
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,304
<i>[Mike] I did some digging around.</i>

583
00:31:57,338 --> 00:31:58,505
And?

584
00:31:58,694 --> 00:32:01,863
Neither the DEA nor the APD

585
00:32:01,897 --> 00:32:03,765
considers you
a person of interest.

586
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:05,266
<i>Schrader's looking into you</i>

587
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,567
<i>totally on his lonesome.</i>

588
00:32:06,602 --> 00:32:08,235
<i>A voice in the wilderness.</i>

589
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,137
Does he have resources?

590
00:32:10,171 --> 00:32:11,671
<i>Just him, his credit card,</i>

591
00:32:11,706 --> 00:32:13,240
<i>and his chauffeur Walter.</i>

592
00:32:13,275 --> 00:32:16,010
From what I hear, he would be
committing career suicide

593
00:32:16,044 --> 00:32:18,245
if he were to mention you
to Merkert again.

594
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,614
<i>So no warrant</i>

595
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:21,081
<i>for the tracking device</i>
<i>on my car.</i>

596
00:32:21,116 --> 00:32:23,651
No. The guy's gone
totally maverick.

597
00:32:23,685 --> 00:32:25,720
He's Miss Daisy with binoculars.

598
00:32:25,754 --> 00:32:27,122
We watch our backs,

599
00:32:27,156 --> 00:32:28,790
make sure we don't
throw him any bones,

600
00:32:28,825 --> 00:32:30,359
he'll never make a case.

601
00:32:30,393 --> 00:32:31,960
What about Chile?

602
00:32:31,994 --> 00:32:34,595
<i>If I can't find any trace</i>
<i>of you before '89,</i>

603
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,097
<i>I seriously doubt Schrader can.</i>

604
00:32:37,132 --> 00:32:40,167
Seems to me the bigger
problem's the cartel.

605
00:32:40,202 --> 00:32:44,071
We can handle them if that's
all we've got on our plate.

606
00:32:44,105 --> 00:32:46,306
But dealing with both Schrader

607
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:49,476
and the Mexicans
at the same time,

608
00:32:49,511 --> 00:32:53,915
if he happens to be watching
when they make a move,

609
00:32:53,949 --> 00:32:56,784
<i>they could be the perfect storm.</i>

610
00:32:56,818 --> 00:32:58,319
Thank you.

611
00:32:58,353 --> 00:33:00,254
I'll be in touch.

612
00:33:50,306 --> 00:33:51,840
Hello, Hector.

613
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:00,081
The cartel has given me
its ultimatum,

614
00:34:00,116 --> 00:34:01,850
to which I've said no.

615
00:34:05,354 --> 00:34:07,588
DEA agent Schrader--

616
00:34:07,622 --> 00:34:09,790
uh, he's a concern.

617
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:14,829
He's looking into my past.

618
00:34:28,842 --> 00:34:31,645
Is today the day, Hector?

619
00:34:37,585 --> 00:34:40,054

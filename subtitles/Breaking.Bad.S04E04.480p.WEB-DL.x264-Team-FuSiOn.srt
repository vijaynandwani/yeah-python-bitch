1
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,056
<i>Ándale.
Mueve el culo, cabrón.</i>

2
00:01:02,112 --> 00:01:03,008
<i>Ya voy. Ya voy.</i>

3
00:01:04,224 --> 00:01:06,016
<i>Ándale! Ábrelo!</i>

4
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:07,968
Did you want me
to open the doors?

5
00:01:08,032 --> 00:01:09,600
<i>¿Qué estás haciendo?
¿Eh?</i>

6
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:11,840
Here.
The keys.

7
00:01:12,224 --> 00:01:13,312
<i>Take them.</i>

8
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:14,944
<i>¿Por qué me estás
hablando en inglés?</i>

9
00:01:15,072 --> 00:01:16,768
Why you talk English, huh?

10
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,112
<i>¿Qué?</i>

11
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:19,360
No! No, no, no! No!

12
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,240
Ohh...

13
00:03:27,744 --> 00:03:29,312
Ahh...


15
00:05:05,952 --> 00:05:08,800
Gambling destroyed my life--

16
00:05:08,832 --> 00:05:13,280
Me, my family,
everything I loved.

17
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:17,888
It was like a robbery,
only I was the thief.

18
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,576
It's amazing, the stories
you tell yourself

19
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:22,048
to justify it--

20
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,008
The lies that lead you
to just one more hand,

21
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,448
one more spin,

22
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,200
one more roll of the dice.

23
00:05:32,448 --> 00:05:34,272
This is our deal, okay?

24
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:36,480
Marie, no.

25
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:39,424
You guys are not lifting
a finger. I mean it.

26
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:40,992
Yeah, we're bringing
everything, so--

27
00:05:41,024 --> 00:05:44,192
This-- This is not
up for debate, okay?

28
00:05:44,224 --> 00:05:46,112
Great.

29
00:05:46,176 --> 00:05:47,936
Now, sweetie,
don't worry, okay?

30
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:49,664
We're not going to say
one word about the bills.

31
00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:52,128
We just want to bring
everyone up to speed, okay?

32
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,920
All right.
I'll see you soon.

33
00:05:53,952 --> 00:05:54,944
Bye.

34
00:06:00,768 --> 00:06:02,464
So...

35
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,736
tonight's the night.

36
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,944
No turning back.

37
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,600
Well...

38
00:06:09,632 --> 00:06:10,976
Okay.

39
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,512
Let's do this.

40
00:06:14,368 --> 00:06:17,472
Okay, so first I assign
point values,

41
00:06:17,504 --> 00:06:20,064
correlate
to the effect of removal.

42
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:21,760
You going to split the 8s?

43
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:23,680
Skyler, please.

44
00:06:23,712 --> 00:06:26,368
Now,
the mathematical principle,

45
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,448
known as the Kelly Criterion,

46
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,880
upon which I devised
my own strategy

47
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:32,512
not dissimilar
to the MIT system.

48
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:35,552
Walt, you're not teaching them.

49
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:37,664
I thought you wanted me
to be thorough.

50
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:39,200
Just play.
You're taking too long.

51
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,216
What, you don't think
it behooves me

52
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:42,816
to be able to explain
any of this?

53
00:06:42,848 --> 00:06:44,832
It behooves you to be a pro,
that's all I'm saying.

54
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:46,592
That's the fiction,
so chop-chop.

55
00:06:46,624 --> 00:06:49,600
Don't chop-chop me.

56
00:06:49,632 --> 00:06:50,656
Walt.

57
00:06:50,688 --> 00:06:53,536
Now, we both know
that the first decision

58
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:57,504
is whether or not to split
or surrender on 8s.

59
00:06:57,536 --> 00:06:59,040
Split 'em.
Mm-hmm.

60
00:07:00,384 --> 00:07:02,112
Good on both.

61
00:07:02,144 --> 00:07:05,056
Next decision is whether
to double down or not.

62
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:06,112
What you should be doing.

63
00:07:06,144 --> 00:07:08,544
On 11, yes. Double.

64
00:07:08,576 --> 00:07:10,720
Okay, this hand over here,

65
00:07:10,752 --> 00:07:12,096
we have a soft 18.

66
00:07:12,128 --> 00:07:14,048
The final decision
is whether or not

67
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,264
is to hit or to stand.

68
00:07:15,296 --> 00:07:16,512
Hit it.

69
00:07:17,824 --> 00:07:19,712
Becomes a hard 15.

70
00:07:19,776 --> 00:07:20,800
Dealer has a 9.

71
00:07:20,832 --> 00:07:22,016
I see that.

72
00:07:22,048 --> 00:07:23,872
Hit it.

73
00:07:23,904 --> 00:07:25,472
Oh.

74
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:27,840
Okay, let's see what I got.

75
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,392
And 21.

76
00:07:31,424 --> 00:07:33,024
Damn.
Yep.

77
00:07:33,056 --> 00:07:34,080
Okay, this--

78
00:07:34,112 --> 00:07:35,424
The key thing to remember here

79
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,984
is that it's not about
any one hand.

80
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:40,704
The key is the number
of hands per hour.

81
00:07:40,736 --> 00:07:41,696
Ooh.

82
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,744
Let's go again.

83
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:47,328
Zero, minus 1.

84
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,632
Okay.

85
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,472
Walt.

86
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:55,968
It's not as if I don't
know how to play.

87
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,400
I certainly
more than understand

88
00:07:58,432 --> 00:07:59,488
how to count cards.

89
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,736
Let's just keep going, okay?

90
00:08:00,768 --> 00:08:03,072
No, you know what?
I'm in recovery.

91
00:08:03,104 --> 00:08:04,096
Remember?

92
00:08:04,128 --> 00:08:06,144
I shouldn't even be playing.

93
00:08:06,176 --> 00:08:07,968
And that is the fiction

94
00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:10,240
that we should be sticking to.

95
00:08:10,272 --> 00:08:11,552
You know what?

96
00:08:13,984 --> 00:08:15,168
You're right.

97
00:08:16,352 --> 00:08:17,312
Yeah.

98
00:08:17,344 --> 00:08:18,912
- Wow.
- Okay.

99
00:08:18,944 --> 00:08:22,496
Um, we're not leaving
anything to chance.

100
00:08:22,528 --> 00:08:25,120
All right, let's get started.

101
00:08:25,152 --> 00:08:26,944
I've got a lot of, uh--

102
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:28,864
Walt,

103
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:31,072
we've got a lot
of ground to cover.

104
00:08:31,104 --> 00:08:32,416
What is this?

105
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:34,016
We have to get
our stories straight.

106
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:35,744
We've got to be
on the same page.

107
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:36,896
Is this a script?

108
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:37,984
Bullet points.

109
00:08:38,016 --> 00:08:39,616
Bullet points?

110
00:08:39,648 --> 00:08:41,248
Like a novella.

111
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,720
This is smart.

112
00:08:42,752 --> 00:08:44,896
You really want to try
to sell a DEA agent

113
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,912
some ill-prepared,

114
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,512
half-assed,
full-of-holes story

115
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:50,048
about how we suddenly
have enough money

116
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,232
to buy a car wash?

117
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,480
Am I supposed to memorize this?

118
00:08:52,512 --> 00:08:54,272
We need to practice, Walt. Yeah.

119
00:08:54,304 --> 00:08:56,192
We need to be
word-perfect.

120
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:57,184
Within reason.

121
00:08:57,216 --> 00:08:58,400
We need this story to be solid

122
00:08:58,432 --> 00:08:59,552
and sympathetic

123
00:08:59,584 --> 00:09:01,504
and most of all
completely believable.

124
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:03,968
From a story that you
already told Marie

125
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,236
and you think that she
hasn't told Hank?

126
00:09:06,368 --> 00:09:09,024
Ha! Come on. This is Marie
we're talking about here.

127
00:09:09,088 --> 00:09:10,080
No, she hasn't.

128
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:12,672
She hasn't.

129
00:09:12,704 --> 00:09:15,456
Hank thinks his insurance
is paying for everything.

130
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,896
Marie's not telling him

131
00:09:16,928 --> 00:09:18,720
that we're paying
his therapy bills,

132
00:09:18,752 --> 00:09:19,968
and neither are we.

133
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,056
And why is that again?

134
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:22,400
Really?

135
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:25,376
If we have
the gambling story...

136
00:09:27,648 --> 00:09:29,728
Did you take money, Walt?

137
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,552
You remember
Gretchen and Elliot?

138
00:09:31,584 --> 00:09:32,992
Because I seem to recall

139
00:09:33,024 --> 00:09:35,040
that you'd rather
sell drugs than take help.

140
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:36,384
Fine.

141
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,208
Marie will tell Hank
in her own time,

142
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,416
and at least we'll have
laid the groundwork.

143
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:43,232
And coming clean
with Hank and Jun--

144
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:48,224
Appearing to come clean

145
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:51,104
will be the best thing
for everyone.

146
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:53,248
We talked about this, okay?

147
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,464
We agreed about this.

148
00:09:54,496 --> 00:09:56,864
Yes, we did. It's just--

149
00:09:58,144 --> 00:09:59,200
What?

150
00:10:00,352 --> 00:10:01,952
Never mind. Just--

151
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:04,480
Okay.

152
00:10:04,512 --> 00:10:07,168
So I really think

153
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,152
we should tag team
the narrative, okay?

154
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:11,712
We'll each be responsible

155
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,056
for certain portions
of the story,

156
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:15,136
and then we can, uh,
we can hand off

157
00:10:15,168 --> 00:10:16,416
so we don't leave anything out,

158
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:18,240
and it'll seem
the most natural.

159
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:20,064
Okay, so I'm going to launch

160
00:10:20,096 --> 00:10:21,856
with the exciting news

161
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:24,352
that we are
buying a car wash--

162
00:10:24,384 --> 00:10:25,760
Yay.

163
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,776
The next logical question

164
00:10:27,808 --> 00:10:29,024
Hank will probably ask

165
00:10:29,056 --> 00:10:30,592
is "Where are you
getting the money?"

166
00:10:30,624 --> 00:10:32,640
Hmm.
To which I'll say

167
00:10:32,704 --> 00:10:34,880
"We want to tell you
the whole story.

168
00:10:34,912 --> 00:10:36,064
"It's a doozy,

169
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:38,272
so hold on
to your hats."

170
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:40,576
Do you like that?

171
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:43,808
Sure.

172
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,880
It accomplishes two things.

173
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,032
It keeps it light

174
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,080
while letting them know
to expect something big.

175
00:10:50,112 --> 00:10:51,520
Uh-huh.

176
00:10:52,512 --> 00:10:54,400
Yeah. No. It's a doozy.

177
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:55,424
Hmm.

178
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:56,640
Okay.

179
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:59,072
Anyway, that's where
you will take over,

180
00:10:59,104 --> 00:11:01,408
starting with your diagnosis,
pages 1 and 2.

181
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,328
Okay, and it's--
It's pretty much

182
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,896
going to run parallel
to the truth,

183
00:11:04,928 --> 00:11:05,984
which makes it easier,

184
00:11:06,016 --> 00:11:07,424
but, um...

185
00:11:07,456 --> 00:11:10,112
just make sure to really
hit the cancer,

186
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:12,160
really touch
on the fear and despair.

187
00:11:12,192 --> 00:11:14,432
It's good to remind them

188
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:16,352
and to get their sympathy
right off the bat.

189
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,440
We want them to understand

190
00:11:17,472 --> 00:11:18,912
why you could do
something so stupid.

191
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,352
Now, after that,

192
00:11:20,384 --> 00:11:21,888
per pages 3 and 4,

193
00:11:21,952 --> 00:11:25,152
after you say...

194
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,008
"Gambling became an addiction,

195
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,544
and I just
couldn't control it."

196
00:11:28,576 --> 00:11:30,176
Do you see that--
Yes.

197
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,808
Right there in the
middle of the page? Okay.

198
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,760
Oh, and I put in
that line about robbery.

199
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,232
You know,
from the G.A. meeting?

200
00:11:35,264 --> 00:11:36,288
I thought that was good.

201
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,952
So next I'll chime in

202
00:11:37,984 --> 00:11:39,488
about how it affected
our marriage,

203
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,016
uh, starting with the,

204
00:11:42,048 --> 00:11:43,360
uh, the deceit,

205
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:44,736
why we couldn't tell anyone.

206
00:11:44,768 --> 00:11:47,776
"...terribly, terribly
ashamed of my actions."

207
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:48,960
Yeah.

208
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:50,336
There's two "terriblys"?

209
00:11:50,368 --> 00:11:51,744
It's supposed
to show contrition.

210
00:11:51,776 --> 00:11:54,272
Well, I just wouldn't
use that word.

211
00:11:54,304 --> 00:11:56,992
I would never say
the word "terribly."

212
00:11:57,056 --> 00:11:59,296
Phrase it however
you want, okay?

213
00:11:59,328 --> 00:12:00,800
You're jumping ahead.
Now--

214
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:04,480
And why--
Why am I so ashamed?

215
00:12:05,536 --> 00:12:07,648
Do I really need
to answer that?

216
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:13,280
I was and am providing
for our family.

217
00:12:16,128 --> 00:12:18,432
Let's just pick up
where we left off.

218
00:12:18,464 --> 00:12:20,576
I'm weak,
and I'm out of control.

219
00:12:20,608 --> 00:12:22,624
I mean, this whole thing
makes me look like crap.

220
00:12:22,656 --> 00:12:25,024
This has to be
a warts-and-all story, Walt.

221
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:27,328
That's how we'll sell it,
and we both look bad.

222
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,760
Oh, well-- How do you
look bad exactly?

223
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:32,864
Where is the "I slept
with my boss" bullet point?

224
00:12:32,896 --> 00:12:35,072
I can't seem to find that
anywhere.

225
00:12:35,104 --> 00:12:38,848
For a fired schoolteacher
who cooks crystal meth,

226
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,280
I'd say you're coming out
pretty much ahead.

227
00:12:41,312 --> 00:12:42,592
I don't like it.

228
00:12:42,624 --> 00:12:44,864
I don't want Junior
thinking less of me.

229
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:46,112
At least you won at gambling.

230
00:12:46,144 --> 00:12:47,520
I'm just the bitch mom

231
00:12:47,552 --> 00:12:50,048
who wouldn't cut you any slack.

232
00:12:56,896 --> 00:12:58,336
I'm sorry.

233
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,912
I'm sorry that I put you
through all of this.

234
00:13:06,112 --> 00:13:08,736
How's that sound? Hmm?

235
00:13:08,768 --> 00:13:09,760
Here.

236
00:13:13,632 --> 00:13:15,040
Two "sorrys."

237
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,584
I believe we were on page 5.

238
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:22,720
So, after you say
how very sorry you are--

239
00:13:22,752 --> 00:13:25,184
In your own words,
of course--

240
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:26,975
We're almost to the end,

241
00:13:26,976 --> 00:13:29,504
and I say how proud I am of you

242
00:13:29,536 --> 00:13:31,392
for joining
a 12-step program,

243
00:13:31,424 --> 00:13:34,912
and-- And this is where
I think we should enact

244
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:36,832
how we're feeling, you know?

245
00:13:36,864 --> 00:13:38,976
Just a--
Just a suggestion.

246
00:13:39,008 --> 00:13:43,488
You might look down
on the floor with remorse.

247
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,896
Hmm?

248
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:50,656
What? You don't
have to mean it.

249
00:13:50,688 --> 00:13:52,992
You just stare down
at your feet, Walt, okay?

250
00:13:53,024 --> 00:13:55,392
Then, uh, I'm gonna--

251
00:13:55,424 --> 00:13:57,728
I was thinking
of taking Marie's hand

252
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,032
and saying something emotional

253
00:14:00,064 --> 00:14:03,200
like "It's such a relief
to tell you.

254
00:14:03,232 --> 00:14:05,056
"We're just so glad
we have a strong family

255
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:06,144
"to help us through this,

256
00:14:06,176 --> 00:14:07,840
that we can all support
each other."

257
00:14:07,872 --> 00:14:12,032
And then maybe
I'll tear up a little.

258
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:13,568
I don't know.

259
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,680
I'll just have to see
what happens in the moment.

260
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:19,328
You're going to cry?
On cue?

261
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,856
I said I don't know.
Maybe.

262
00:14:21,888 --> 00:14:23,872
When you dab your eyes,
you going to do it

263
00:14:23,936 --> 00:14:25,440
with your right hand
or your left?

264
00:14:25,504 --> 00:14:26,368
It's just an idea.
One tear? Two tears?

265
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,320
This has to be convincing,

266
00:14:28,352 --> 00:14:29,792
especially to Hank.

267
00:14:29,824 --> 00:14:32,032
I'm doing the best
I can here, Walt.

268
00:14:32,064 --> 00:14:33,888
And yes, I'm thorough.

269
00:14:35,392 --> 00:14:38,720
Maybe lying doesn't
come as easily to me

270
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,224
as it does to you.

271
00:14:56,448 --> 00:14:57,984
Hey!
Guys! Come on in.

272
00:14:58,016 --> 00:14:59,584
Hi. Good to see you.

273
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:02,048
Hey. Put her there,
you little punk.

274
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,264
Hi.
Hey.

275
00:15:03,296 --> 00:15:04,384
Great to see you, Hank.

276
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,504
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

277
00:15:05,536 --> 00:15:06,688
Oh, look at my little princess.

278
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,904
She's getting big, huh?

279
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:09,600
An heavy, too.

280
00:15:09,632 --> 00:15:11,552
Whoa, is that actual
food I'm smelling?

281
00:15:11,616 --> 00:15:13,568
I might get an honest-to-God
meal here for once?

282
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,656
You look good.

283
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,840
Thank you, sweetheart.

284
00:15:15,872 --> 00:15:17,152
Your aunt Marie, she's cute,

285
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:18,208
but she could burn water,

286
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,264
you know what I'm saying?

287
00:15:19,296 --> 00:15:21,344
You are so very hilarious.

288
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:23,008
Go show the boys
your new rock collection.

289
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,416
We're going to get things
organized.

290
00:15:24,448 --> 00:15:25,728
Yeah, it'll be
about 10 minutes.

291
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,784
You have a rock collection?

292
00:15:26,816 --> 00:15:28,416
It's a mineral collection.

293
00:15:28,448 --> 00:15:30,016
Uh, just a little
something I--

294
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:31,680
You guys want to see it?
Want to see it?

295
00:15:31,712 --> 00:15:32,960
Sure.
Let's go see it.

296
00:15:32,992 --> 00:15:34,144
Oh, hey, let me.

297
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,608
Hey, it's all right.
I got it.

298
00:15:37,952 --> 00:15:40,032
Come on, guys,
it's down the hall here.

299
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,408
Now that one there,
that's Rhodonite, okay?

300
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,296
It's manganese inosilicate.

301
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:48,928
Cool.

302
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,976
What-- What makes it
be all pink like that?

303
00:15:51,008 --> 00:15:52,992
Well, that's
the manganese part, okay?

304
00:15:53,024 --> 00:15:55,872
It-- It oxidizes,
you know, like rust.

305
00:15:55,904 --> 00:15:57,600
Exactly. Manganese can
have an oxidation state

306
00:15:57,632 --> 00:16:00,064
of between -3 and +7,

307
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:02,304
which takes it through
a range of colors--

308
00:16:02,368 --> 00:16:03,488
Purple, green, blue.

309
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,856
But its most stable state
is +2,

310
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:08,256
which is usually pale pink.

311
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:11,808
So...

312
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,848
Exactly. Whatever
the hell he said.

313
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,104
Anyway, you, uh,
you get the idea.

314
00:16:19,136 --> 00:16:21,536
Yeah, it's, uh, interesting.

315
00:16:21,568 --> 00:16:23,520
Interesting stuff, that.

316
00:16:23,552 --> 00:16:24,736
Really.

317
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,336
Oh, hey, uh,

318
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:32,928
here. Give me
that file, will you?

319
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,912
You got to check this out.

320
00:16:34,944 --> 00:16:37,952
I, uh, have been working
on something here.

321
00:16:37,984 --> 00:16:40,192
Been a little, uh,
little consulting--

322
00:16:40,224 --> 00:16:43,616
You know, weighing in
on a case for APD.

323
00:16:44,992 --> 00:16:46,976
Put that in, will you?

324
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:49,024
Put that in over there.

325
00:16:49,056 --> 00:16:52,288
Uh, Hank, what is this?
It's not a dead body--

326
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,336
No, no, no, no.
Nothing like that.

327
00:16:54,368 --> 00:16:56,832
You guys-- Seriously,
you got to check this out.

328
00:16:56,864 --> 00:16:58,240
This is good. Ready?

329
00:16:58,272 --> 00:16:59,744
Here we go on here.

330
00:17:04,576 --> 00:17:06,496
Look at this guy.

331
00:17:06,528 --> 00:17:07,840
Look.

00:17:15,456 --> 00:17:16,896

That, my friends,

00:17:31,776 --> 00:17:34,848

It's such a relief
to finally tell you.

349
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:46,688
We're just so glad

350
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,328
that we have a strong family
to help us through this,

351
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,992
that we can all
support each other.

352
00:17:55,072 --> 00:17:56,768
Jesus.

353
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,496
I don't even know where--

354
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:00,480
Holy shit.

355
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:01,472
Yeah.

356
00:18:03,488 --> 00:18:06,080
Walter H. Whyte.

357
00:18:06,112 --> 00:18:08,640
Man of hidden talents.

358
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:12,384
Dad, you're such a stud.

359
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,944
How much did you win exactly?

360
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,368
Dad?

361
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,928
I-- I don't think
I have exact figures.

362
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,400
It's, uh,
it's enough to--

363
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:24,128
Uh, after taxes,
of course--

364
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,792
To buy the car wash.

365
00:18:25,824 --> 00:18:29,312
Maybe even pay for

366
00:18:29,344 --> 00:18:32,288
a couple of halfway
reasonable college educations.

367
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,712
Damn, Dad, why'd you quit?

368
00:18:35,744 --> 00:18:40,256
I can totally get a car
for my birthday now.

369
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:41,856
Right?

370
00:18:45,184 --> 00:18:47,712
Son, I'm...

371
00:18:47,744 --> 00:18:52,000
terribly, terrible
ashamed of my actions.

372
00:18:53,504 --> 00:18:55,680
Would you excuse me, please?

373
00:18:55,712 --> 00:18:57,600
I need to use the restroom.

374
00:19:03,648 --> 00:19:04,800
Wow.

375
00:19:28,096 --> 00:19:29,184
Walt?

376
00:19:39,968 --> 00:19:41,280
Hey. Whoa, whoa.

377
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:43,040
Oh. Sorry. I--

378
00:19:43,072 --> 00:19:44,704
I thought you might
have fallen in there.

379
00:19:44,736 --> 00:19:48,000
Uh, no, no. I just, uh--

380
00:19:48,032 --> 00:19:50,976
Hey, man, that was
some big stuff back there.

381
00:19:52,768 --> 00:19:55,648
Yeah, we wanted
to be thorough, so--

382
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,592
Yeah, well, it's quite a tale.

383
00:19:58,624 --> 00:20:03,072
It couldn't have been
easy to talk about.

384
00:20:05,376 --> 00:20:07,392
You know, Walt, if you...

385
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:10,080
you can always
bend my ear, right?

386
00:20:10,112 --> 00:20:11,936
I mean, if you ever
need to talk or--

387
00:20:11,968 --> 00:20:13,728
Or just blow off some steam.

388
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,192
I'm-- I'm here.

389
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,680
Not going anywhere.

390
00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:22,784
Thanks, Hank.

391
00:20:27,456 --> 00:20:28,992
Same goes for me, you know.

392
00:20:29,024 --> 00:20:32,032
If you ever want to bounce
anything off me.

393
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:36,448
I don't know, case work,
anything, really.

394
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,232
Sometimes just talking
something through,

395
00:20:39,264 --> 00:20:41,280
you know, really
can make a difference.

396
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:44,384
I mean, we're
definitely not talking,

397
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,632
you know, bathtub crank here.

398
00:20:45,696 --> 00:20:48,032
This is a big-ass
operation.

399
00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:50,176
You know, hundreds
of pounds a week,

400
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,000
maybe more.

401
00:20:52,032 --> 00:20:54,144
So, uh...

402
00:20:54,176 --> 00:20:58,208
who is this person?
What do you know about him?

403
00:20:58,272 --> 00:21:00,800
Other than the fact that he's
deader than a Texas salad bar

404
00:21:00,832 --> 00:21:02,336
and has a decent set of pipes?

405
00:21:02,368 --> 00:21:04,224
I'd say he's my guy.

406
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:06,528
Your guy?

407
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,888
There's this, uh, mystery man

408
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,616
I've been, uh, chasing

409
00:21:11,648 --> 00:21:14,048
for the better part of a year.

410
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,480
Cooks the purest meth

411
00:21:16,512 --> 00:21:19,648
that, uh, me or anyone
else has ever seen.

412
00:21:20,992 --> 00:21:22,976
Goes by the name of Heisenberg.

413
00:21:25,568 --> 00:21:26,784
Hmm.

414
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:28,032
Yeah.
Pretty weird, huh?

415
00:21:28,064 --> 00:21:30,304
I-- I--
I looked him up.

416
00:21:30,368 --> 00:21:31,520
It, uh, it was one
of these physicists--

417
00:21:31,552 --> 00:21:32,832
One of Hitler's guys,

418
00:21:32,864 --> 00:21:34,528
a physicist
named Werner Heisenberg.

419
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,056
Real cute, huh?

420
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,072
Anyway, I figure
with a handle like that,

421
00:21:39,104 --> 00:21:40,992
you know, my guy's got to be

422
00:21:41,024 --> 00:21:43,200
some sort of an egghead.
No offense.

423
00:21:43,232 --> 00:21:44,992
And here we go--

424
00:21:45,024 --> 00:21:47,968
Gale "Major Tom" Boetticher.

425
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,240
Anyway, I-- I--
I just want to see

426
00:21:50,272 --> 00:21:53,344
if I'm, you know, not
barking up the wrong tree

427
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:54,720
chemically speaking.

428
00:21:54,752 --> 00:21:56,960
Uh, as far as I can make out,

429
00:21:56,992 --> 00:22:01,536
he's writing about
phenylacetone cook, right?

430
00:22:02,944 --> 00:22:04,192
Yeah.

431
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:06,304
Yeah. That's pretty
rare these days,

432
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,840
but it-- It does jive

433
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,312
with the blue stuff
I've been tracking.

434
00:22:09,344 --> 00:22:11,904
"2 sticks dairy free
soy margarine,

435
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:14,560
2/3 cup turbinado sugar"?

436
00:22:15,744 --> 00:22:18,432
It's a recipe
for vegan s'mores.

437
00:22:18,464 --> 00:22:21,568
Hmm. There's all kinds
of crazy crap in there.

438
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,656
Yeah, like, uh, you know,

439
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:24,832
top ten recumbent bicycles,

440
00:22:24,896 --> 00:22:26,368
indoor composting tips.

441
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,872
All right next to the--

442
00:22:27,904 --> 00:22:31,904
The mother of, uh, of
methamphetamine synthesis.

443
00:22:31,968 --> 00:22:33,824
This guy was a, uh--

444
00:22:33,856 --> 00:22:36,704
Man, he was a real character.

445
00:22:36,736 --> 00:22:40,224
Yeah, he seems, uh, unique.

446
00:22:40,256 --> 00:22:41,920
Here, let me-- Let me--
Let me show you something.

447
00:22:41,952 --> 00:22:43,072
Give it-- Give it.

448
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:47,648
Right here at the, uh--

449
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,800
And here's the top.
It says, uh, "To W.W.

450
00:22:52,832 --> 00:22:55,296
My star,
my perfect silence."

451
00:22:55,328 --> 00:22:56,320
Huh.

452
00:22:56,352 --> 00:22:58,848
W.W.

453
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,664
I mean, who do you
figure that is, huh?

454
00:23:01,696 --> 00:23:04,512
Woodrow Wilson?

455
00:23:04,544 --> 00:23:06,592
Willy Wonka?

456
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,816
Walter Whyte?

457
00:23:14,048 --> 00:23:15,328
You got me.

458
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:20,864
W.W.

459
00:23:20,896 --> 00:23:23,296
Hey, man, let me see this...

460
00:23:24,992 --> 00:23:27,488
for a second because
I think I remembered...

461
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,272
Ah. Here.

462
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,448
Yes.

463
00:23:34,464 --> 00:23:35,648
Yeah.

464
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,368
"When I heard
the learn'd astronomer..."

465
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,216
Learned.
"And from time to time

466
00:23:41,248 --> 00:23:43,968
"looked up in perfect silence

467
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,080
at the stars."

468
00:23:46,144 --> 00:23:49,664
It's a poem by Walt Whitman.

469
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:51,744
Your W.W.

470
00:23:52,896 --> 00:23:55,264
You frickin' braniac.

471
00:23:55,296 --> 00:23:57,024
Ha.
You frickin' braniac.

472
00:23:57,088 --> 00:23:58,528
Ha ha ha!

473
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,736
I must have skipped that day
in school or something.

474
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,304
I don't know.
Hee hee!

475
00:24:02,336 --> 00:24:04,448
I've been chasing my tail
about that one, you know?

476
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,408
I bet you're right.

477
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,680
Well, I'm glad
I could be of help.

478
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:11,232
Yeah.
Walt Whitman, huh.

479
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:15,424
So, uh, you think
this Gale person

480
00:24:15,456 --> 00:24:16,832
is your Heisenberg?

481
00:24:16,864 --> 00:24:19,200
Yeah, I think so.
I don't know.

482
00:24:19,232 --> 00:24:21,024
God, I wanted to get this guy.

483
00:24:23,872 --> 00:24:25,344
It looks like you did.

484
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:29,088
No, I mean, you know,
me personally.

485
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,712
I wanted to be the one
to slap the handcuffs on him,

486
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,504
that kind of shit.

487
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:36,672
Popeye Doyle
waving to Frog One.

488
00:24:39,552 --> 00:24:41,152
If I recall,

489
00:24:41,184 --> 00:24:43,744
<i>at least from the first
French Connection,</i>

490
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:47,744
Popeye Doyle never
actually caught him.

491
00:24:47,808 --> 00:24:48,800
Ha.

492
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:53,184
Yeah, I guess me
and old Popeye, huh?

493
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,264
A day late and a dollar short.

494
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,456
What about the person
who killed him?

495
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,920
APD's problem, not mine.

496
00:25:05,952 --> 00:25:07,168
Any leads?

497
00:25:07,232 --> 00:25:08,608
My buddy Tim says

498
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,272
he's got some fingerprints
they're trying to ID,

499
00:25:10,336 --> 00:25:12,800
and an eyewitness
saw a person of interest.

500
00:25:12,832 --> 00:25:14,080
Might get lucky there.

501
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:15,296
I guess somebody
knows something.

502
00:25:15,328 --> 00:25:18,080
They'll track down
the shooter eventually.

503
00:25:19,136 --> 00:25:20,608
Jesse!

504
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,312
Excuse me.

505
00:25:49,504 --> 00:25:50,816
Jesse?

506
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,704
What's up?

507
00:26:01,888 --> 00:26:05,056
I need to talk to you, okay?

508
00:26:10,176 --> 00:26:12,416
Now.

509
00:26:12,448 --> 00:26:13,600
Go ahead.

510
00:26:17,088 --> 00:26:20,896
Would you stop doing
what you're doing, please?

511
00:26:20,928 --> 00:26:23,744
When I'm done, yo,
that dude's next.

512
00:26:27,104 --> 00:26:28,480
What the hell?
What is wrong--

513
00:26:28,512 --> 00:26:31,136
I have some business
to discuss.

514
00:26:31,168 --> 00:26:34,016
So discuss. Jesus.

515
00:26:34,048 --> 00:26:35,296
Let go of me.

516
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:37,536
Gale's murder is
being investigated.

517
00:26:37,568 --> 00:26:39,456
Uh, duh.

518
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,960
And I have it on good authority

519
00:26:40,992 --> 00:26:43,808
that they found
fingerprints at the scene.

520
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,536
Not mine.

521
00:26:47,392 --> 00:26:48,896
We done here?

522
00:26:48,928 --> 00:26:50,272
No, we are not done here.

523
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:51,968
What if they are yours?

524
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,216
How can you be so sure?

525
00:26:53,248 --> 00:26:55,136
Because I'm here, all right?

526
00:26:55,168 --> 00:26:57,152
Your brother-in-law's
got such a hardon for me

527
00:26:57,184 --> 00:26:58,816
that if the cops would have
found my fingerprints--

528
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,224
Shh.

529
00:27:00,256 --> 00:27:01,696
The cops would have
found my fingerprints

530
00:27:01,728 --> 00:27:02,976
within five blocks
of that place,

531
00:27:03,008 --> 00:27:04,992
they would have
picked me up by now.

532
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,904
What about the casing?

533
00:27:07,936 --> 00:27:10,208
Or casings? How--

534
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,736
How many times did you
shoot him anyway?

535
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:18,400
Jesse, did you pick up
the casings?

536
00:27:18,432 --> 00:27:21,056
Did you pick them up?

537
00:27:21,088 --> 00:27:22,272
No.

538
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:29,056
Listen, uh, we've got
to go over this

539
00:27:29,088 --> 00:27:31,616
step by step--
Everything.

540
00:27:31,648 --> 00:27:33,696
I want you to tell me
exactly what happened

541
00:27:33,728 --> 00:27:35,104
from the moment you got there.

542
00:27:35,136 --> 00:27:36,800
I got in, I got out.

543
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:40,000
No. No, I need to know
specifics.

544
00:27:40,032 --> 00:27:41,728
Now, we'll start
from the beginning.

545
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,064
You-- You drove there.
You drove over there.

546
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:45,824
You went to his door, right?

547
00:27:48,224 --> 00:27:50,592
Jesse,
I need you to concentrate.

548
00:27:50,624 --> 00:27:51,584
This is very important.

549
00:27:51,616 --> 00:27:53,056
Did you knock or ring?

550
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,648
Knock or ring?
Uhh!

551
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,152
Knock.

552
00:27:57,184 --> 00:27:59,328
Okay, good.
That's very good.

553
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,056
Now listen.

554
00:28:01,088 --> 00:28:03,296
I assume that Gale
answered the door.

555
00:28:03,328 --> 00:28:04,608
Now what happened after that?

556
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,080
Did he recognize you?

557
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:08,288
Did you say anything
to each other?

558
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,664
Did you walk into the room,

559
00:28:09,696 --> 00:28:12,448
or did you shoot him
right then and there?

560
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,472
What?

561
00:28:15,776 --> 00:28:18,272
Who wants to make
a hundred bucks?

562
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,520
Huh?

563
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,080
Look, the kid's probably right.

564
00:28:38,112 --> 00:28:40,128
If they had anything on him,

565
00:28:40,192 --> 00:28:41,920
he'd be locked up already.

566
00:28:41,952 --> 00:28:43,744
What about
my brother-in-law?

567
00:28:43,776 --> 00:28:45,280
He suspects Jess--

568
00:28:45,312 --> 00:28:47,424
Hell, he knows Jesse
is involved

569
00:28:47,456 --> 00:28:49,472
in the sale of blue meth.

570
00:28:49,504 --> 00:28:52,928
That was Hank's
one and only lead.

571
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,456
Now what if he puts
2 and 2 together

572
00:28:55,488 --> 00:28:57,696
and he goes after Jesse
for the murder?

573
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,192
He goes after him how,
on his Rascal Scooter?

574
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,960
Ahem. That, perhaps,
sounded insensitive.

575
00:29:04,992 --> 00:29:07,584
Uh, but if he goes after him,

576
00:29:07,616 --> 00:29:10,144
I'll sue his ass
for police brutality,

577
00:29:10,176 --> 00:29:12,800
harassment, assault,
and 16 other things.

578
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,944
Now, the history that
those two have together

579
00:29:14,976 --> 00:29:16,224
being what it is,

580
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:17,760
you got to figure
your brother-in-law's

581
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:20,544
smart enough not to go
down that particular road.

582
00:29:20,576 --> 00:29:22,944
Goose egg, bupkis--

583
00:29:22,976 --> 00:29:24,640
That's what the cops got.

584
00:29:24,704 --> 00:29:26,944
I wouldn't worry about it.

585
00:29:27,008 --> 00:29:30,496
What else should I not
worry about, Saul, hmm?

586
00:29:30,528 --> 00:29:33,184
Should I not worry
that Gus plans to murder me

587
00:29:33,248 --> 00:29:34,624
at the first chance he gets?

588
00:29:34,656 --> 00:29:36,896
Should I not worry
that my drug-addicted partner

589
00:29:36,928 --> 00:29:39,328
doesn't seem to care
whether he lives or dies?

590
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,536
You should see his house.

591
00:29:41,568 --> 00:29:44,512
It's-- It's like Skid Row.

592
00:29:44,544 --> 00:29:47,712
He has actual hobos
living there.

593
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,568
Now how long before Gus decides

594
00:29:49,632 --> 00:29:51,392
that he's too big of a risk?

595
00:29:51,424 --> 00:29:53,088
Geez, that Mike,

596
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,544
that grunting
dead-eyed cretin

597
00:29:56,576 --> 00:29:59,104
sucker-punching me
in the-- In the face.

598
00:29:59,136 --> 00:30:01,600
I've got Gus
wielding a box cutter.

599
00:30:01,632 --> 00:30:05,664
I mean, Western Union--
Message received.

600
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:08,320
It--

601
00:30:08,352 --> 00:30:10,048
Let me ask you.

602
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,728
When did this stop
being a business, hmm?

603
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,360
Why am I the only person

604
00:30:15,392 --> 00:30:17,952
capable of behaving
in a professional manner?

605
00:30:19,456 --> 00:30:20,416
No, I--

606
00:30:21,632 --> 00:30:25,824
No, any way you slice it,
everyone's in danger.

607
00:30:27,136 --> 00:30:30,400
I mean, how--
How can I protect anyone?

608
00:30:30,432 --> 00:30:33,088
My family, Jesse, myself?

609
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,376
My name never comes up
with those guys, does it?

610
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:44,416
Meanwhile, we're buying
this stupid car wash.

611
00:30:44,448 --> 00:30:47,616
Oh. Yeah.
That ship has sailed.

612
00:30:47,648 --> 00:30:49,568
Bon voyage.

613
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,848
We are committed.

614
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,992
We already told
our family about it,

615
00:30:53,024 --> 00:30:56,064
and now Skyler,
I'm sure she believes--

616
00:30:56,128 --> 00:30:57,856
She needs to believe

617
00:30:57,888 --> 00:31:00,512
that everything
is neat and tidy,

618
00:31:00,544 --> 00:31:01,888
and she's telling herself

619
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,120
that I work in this nice
quiet little lab

620
00:31:05,152 --> 00:31:07,264
with a white lab coat
and a pocket protector

621
00:31:07,296 --> 00:31:09,120
and when my contract is up

622
00:31:09,152 --> 00:31:10,752
I'll just simply
hang it all up,

623
00:31:10,784 --> 00:31:12,864
tip my hat, and walk away.

624
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,880
Oh, God.

625
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,400
How did everything
get so screwed up?

626
00:31:24,704 --> 00:31:27,808
Yeah, you do have a little
shit creek action happening.

627
00:31:35,968 --> 00:31:40,992
You know, FYI,
you can buy a paddle.

628
00:31:42,752 --> 00:31:45,600
This is a last resort
back pocket kind of thing,

629
00:31:45,632 --> 00:31:47,872
but if you really
got to protect yourself,

630
00:31:47,904 --> 00:31:50,624
uh...disappear.

631
00:31:51,904 --> 00:31:53,504
Poof.

632
00:31:54,784 --> 00:31:55,936
Poof?

633
00:31:55,968 --> 00:31:58,400
There's a guy
who can make it happen.

634
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,480
Call him a, uh...

635
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,592
disappearer.

636
00:32:02,624 --> 00:32:06,432
For a substantial fee,
and I do mean substantial,

637
00:32:06,464 --> 00:32:10,432
you and your loved ones
can vanish, untraceable.

638
00:32:10,464 --> 00:32:13,312
I mean, he sets you up
with a whole new life.

639
00:32:13,376 --> 00:32:15,712
What, like a...

640
00:32:15,744 --> 00:32:18,528
witness protection
kind of thing?

641
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,024
Beyond.
I mean, off the grid.

642
00:32:21,056 --> 00:32:23,072
New identities, new everything.

643
00:32:23,104 --> 00:32:25,696
No one would ever
be able to trace you.

644
00:32:25,728 --> 00:32:28,896
Now, be clear,
this is an end game,

645
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,080
if you get my meaning.

646
00:32:30,112 --> 00:32:31,744
I mean, there's no coming back.

647
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:37,696
Sh--

648
00:32:37,728 --> 00:32:39,264
You want his card?

649
00:32:43,904 --> 00:32:45,312
Ahh.

650
00:32:45,376 --> 00:32:48,512
God, there's got to be
something else that I could do.

651
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:53,024
Some way to keep everything
from spiraling out of control.

652
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:54,688
Well, I mean,
from what you told me,

653
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,216
it sounds like, uh,
Pinkman is first up

654
00:32:57,248 --> 00:32:59,168
in the imminent demise
department.

655
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,504
Gus won't risk letting
the police find Jesse.

656
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:07,712
I know him. He won't.

657
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,552
I'm not even kidding

658
00:33:31,584 --> 00:33:32,992
because if you really
think about it,

659
00:33:33,056 --> 00:33:34,240
you can't even see it,

660
00:33:34,272 --> 00:33:35,904
so how can you know
just how bad

661
00:33:35,936 --> 00:33:37,152
radio frequencies
and microwaves

662
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:38,816
and cell phones and stuff
are getting you?

663
00:33:38,848 --> 00:33:40,480
I mean, you could be
strolling through security

664
00:33:40,512 --> 00:33:43,072
at the airport on the way
to visit your grandma or--

665
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,640
Wake up, bitches!

666
00:33:44,672 --> 00:33:46,048
And then you get waved

667
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,128
through a full-body
X-ray scanner,

668
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,792
and the next day
you could be dead

669
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,064
or dying from all the radiation
that they say is safe,

670
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:53,376
but there's no way.

671
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,040
It could be because
they have to deliver

672
00:33:55,072 --> 00:33:56,192
a concentrated dose, okay?

673
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,632
Enough to penetrate
through clothes,

674
00:33:57,664 --> 00:33:58,816
and so the accumulated amount

675
00:33:58,848 --> 00:34:00,096
could definitely be dangerous

676
00:34:00,128 --> 00:34:01,440
to susceptible
individuals--

677
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:02,688
Hey, yo.

678
00:34:02,752 --> 00:34:04,320
Especially if you're
from a rural area

679
00:34:04,352 --> 00:34:05,952
and the ozone layer's
already thin-- Yo.

680
00:34:05,984 --> 00:34:07,136
Because of the cow farts.

681
00:34:07,168 --> 00:34:08,512
Yo!

682
00:34:08,544 --> 00:34:09,856
Oh, hey.

683
00:34:09,888 --> 00:34:10,976
Will you make sure

684
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:12,512
there's pizza here
when I get back?

685
00:34:12,544 --> 00:34:13,760
Enough for everybody.

686
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:16,704
Oh. Oh, yeah.
I can do that.

687
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:18,432
I can definitely do that.
All right?

688
00:34:18,464 --> 00:34:19,744
Not a problem, all right?

689
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,824
I can get the stuff,
the pizza and stuff,

690
00:34:21,856 --> 00:34:24,832
but as-- As far as the
financial situation, you know.

691
00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:31,648
Just hang on, hang on.

692
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,600
Oh, yeah. You know,

693
00:34:33,632 --> 00:34:36,096
and, you know, if there's
a concentrated dose,

694
00:34:36,128 --> 00:34:37,376
it's really-- It's gonna--

695
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,744
It's gonna play hob
with your bone marrow,

696
00:34:39,776 --> 00:34:41,216
and it's really
gonna mess up--

697
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,904
Because-- Because--
Because, especially,

698
00:34:55,936 --> 00:34:57,984
if you have cancer,
and you know,

699
00:34:58,016 --> 00:35:01,472
because if you got to get
a bone marrow transplant,

700
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,104
your odds are-- Are 60%.

701
00:35:03,136 --> 00:35:04,416
You have a 60% chance.

702
00:35:04,448 --> 00:35:06,080
Hey.

703
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,232
Oh.

704
00:35:08,768 --> 00:35:11,104
Hey. Hey!

705
00:35:11,136 --> 00:35:13,344
Get some dipping sticks
too, yo.

706
00:35:13,376 --> 00:35:16,288
Uh, I can-- I can
definitely get dipping sticks.

707
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,784
All right. I can get them.

708
00:36:36,544 --> 00:36:39,808
Hey. Smoke it up,
bitches.

709
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,776
<i>Gotcha!</i>

710
00:38:05,728 --> 00:38:06,848
Wake up.

711
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:11,232
Wake up.

712
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,288
What's up?

713
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,952
What's up with your ear?

714
00:38:21,984 --> 00:38:23,776
Downstairs now.

715
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,384
Where is everybody?

716
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:34,688
I invited your guests to leave.

717
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,896
Know who this is?

718
00:38:44,928 --> 00:38:46,272
No.

719
00:38:46,304 --> 00:38:47,488
You ought to.

720
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,112
He's been at your house
for three solid days.

721
00:38:50,144 --> 00:38:51,679
Okay.

722
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,536
He stole your money.

723
00:38:53,568 --> 00:38:54,560
Okay.

724
00:38:56,224 --> 00:39:00,416
That $78,000 or so
look familiar?

725
00:39:00,448 --> 00:39:01,696
This is it?

726
00:39:01,728 --> 00:39:02,720
That's it.

727
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:07,936
Okay, thanks.

728
00:39:12,512 --> 00:39:14,080
You want to know what's next

729
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:15,000
for Little Miss
Pissed In His Pants?

730
00:39:16,032 --> 00:39:16,992
No.

731
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:17,984
You sure now?

732
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,200
Yep.

733
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:21,728
Don't even want
to take a wild guess?

734
00:39:23,296 --> 00:39:26,528
You're gonna kill him.

735
00:39:27,808 --> 00:39:29,728
Is this the part where I'm
supposed to beg you

736
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,584
not to do it?

737
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:34,112
Aw, please, please.

738
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:36,224
And then what?

739
00:39:36,256 --> 00:39:39,648
I'm supposed to promise,
cross my heart,

740
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,600
to, like, straighten up
and fly right

741
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:43,552
or toe the line
or some other crap

742
00:39:43,584 --> 00:39:44,960
that I'm not gonna say?

743
00:39:44,992 --> 00:39:48,608
Is that what your little show
here was all about?

744
00:39:49,824 --> 00:39:52,576
You're on thin ice,
you little shit head.

745
00:39:52,608 --> 00:39:54,112
You know that?

746
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,616
You ain't gonna
smoke that dude in there.

747
00:39:59,648 --> 00:40:01,376
You know how come I know?

748
00:40:01,408 --> 00:40:02,976
Because you went to the trouble

749
00:40:03,008 --> 00:40:04,800
of putting a blindfold on him.

750
00:40:09,664 --> 00:40:11,904
I'm going back to bed.

751
00:40:11,936 --> 00:40:13,824
Let yourselves out.

752
00:40:25,568 --> 00:40:27,104
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

753
00:40:29,024 --> 00:40:30,592
How's the ear?

754
00:40:30,656 --> 00:40:31,872
Mending.

755
00:40:39,488 --> 00:40:41,280
What can I do for you?

756
00:40:41,312 --> 00:40:42,848
It's Pinkman.

757
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,632
He's become increasingly
incautious.

758
00:40:45,664 --> 00:40:48,960
He's a risk, a liability.

759
00:40:48,992 --> 00:40:51,232
I know he and Walter
come as a team

760
00:40:51,264 --> 00:40:53,568
and that Walter won't like it.

761
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,384
But something's got to be done.

762
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,952
Got to be kidding me.

763
00:41:41,216 --> 00:41:42,560
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

764
00:41:42,592 --> 00:41:44,128
<i>Wait for the thing.</i>

765
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,832
All right,
this is message number 3.

766
00:41:48,864 --> 00:41:50,656
You better be ready
in two minutes

767
00:41:50,688 --> 00:41:52,736
because I am right outside
your door.

768
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,144
Jesse!

769
00:42:01,312 --> 00:42:02,400
Jesse!

770
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,416
Damn it.

771
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:16,512
<i>Hey, it's me.
Wait for the thing.</i>

772
00:42:16,544 --> 00:42:17,696
Oh, great.

773
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:22,528
Jesse!

774
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,768
Oh, this is perfect.

775
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,360
You are a piece of work,
you know that?

776
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,280
Jesse?

777
00:42:45,088 --> 00:42:46,080
Jesse.

778
00:42:49,536 --> 00:42:50,912
Jesse?

779
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:20,704
<i>Hey, it's me.
Wait for the thing.</i>

780
00:43:44,256 --> 00:43:45,728
Where is he?

781
00:44:05,824 --> 00:44:08,032
Going to ask where we're going?

782
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:11,328
Nope.

1
00:00:06,681 --> 00:00:08,460
Here's my résumé.

2
00:00:08,622 --> 00:00:11,981
I mean, technically
it says "curriculum vitae,"

3
00:00:12,088 --> 00:00:14,977
which I think
is more professional, but,

4
00:00:15,204 --> 00:00:18,024
you know,
same thing pretty much.

5
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:22,732
Great. But this position truly is
a no-experience-necessary kind of thing.

6
00:00:22,788 --> 00:00:26,387
Well, and it doesn't
really say it here,

7
00:00:26,598 --> 00:00:30,240
but I have a solid
background in sales.

8
00:00:30,586 --> 00:00:32,961
I'm pretty much
a self-starter, so.

9
00:00:32,962 --> 00:00:35,855
- That's excellent, but...
- Excellent.

10
00:00:36,464 --> 00:00:39,276
I really feel
I could be a major,

11
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:42,591
major asset
to your sales force.

12
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:47,684
I'm thinking there's
a little misunderstanding.

13
00:00:47,724 --> 00:00:50,179
This isn't actually
a sales job. I mean,

14
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:52,650
I'd be happy to consider
you for a sales position,

15
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:55,495
but our agents
need to be licensed,

16
00:00:55,562 --> 00:00:58,190
have at least two years
on-the-job experience,

17
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,417
and usually a college degree.

18
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:07,789
What you would be doing
is more like... advertising.

19
00:01:21,836 --> 00:01:23,055
Hey, Jesse!

20
00:01:23,597 --> 00:01:24,792
Hey, man!

21
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:27,940
Yo, man! What up?

22
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:29,212
Badger?

23
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:31,583
Where you been
keeping yourself?

24
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:33,780
Nice duds.

25
00:01:34,607 --> 00:01:36,073
Yeah. You, too.

26
00:01:36,462 --> 00:01:37,433
Thanks.

27
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,391
Yo, why would you want to do
this lame ass job anyway?

28
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:43,212
I mean, no offense.

29
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:45,371
Because I'm
on probation, yo.

30
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:48,201
Gotta prove to the man
I'm rehabilitated.

31
00:01:48,464 --> 00:01:51,754
Upstanding citizen.
All that shit.

32
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:53,914
It's really good
exercise, too.

33
00:01:53,952 --> 00:01:57,264
Look. You can't just stand there.
You have to spin the arrow.

34
00:01:57,298 --> 00:02:01,020
There's all these moves you have
to learn, like the helicopter.

35
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:06,798
See?

36
00:02:07,536 --> 00:02:09,042
That one's a bitch.

37
00:02:09,153 --> 00:02:10,673
I'm not very good
at it yet.

38
00:02:10,702 --> 00:02:13,912
No, you really opened my eyes
to the possibilities.

39
00:02:14,498 --> 00:02:15,973
Hey, anyways...

40
00:02:16,902 --> 00:02:18,951
- Thanks for the toke.
- Anytime.

41
00:02:19,024 --> 00:02:20,607
Speaking of which...

42
00:02:21,505 --> 00:02:24,915
You think you could maybe
hook me up with some crystal?

43
00:02:26,107 --> 00:02:29,526
Nah, I've been out of the business
for a while actually now.

44
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:32,878
- Thinking about retiring.
- What? No!

45
00:02:33,328 --> 00:02:35,551
That stuff you made
is unbelievable.

46
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,393
It was pretty awesome.

47
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:38,935
Retirement?

48
00:02:39,857 --> 00:02:41,449
I can't be hearing this!

49
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:44,816
I had this partner
who was helping me cook.

50
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,185
I mean, I was doing
most of the work, but...

51
00:02:50,226 --> 00:02:52,204
he was an asshole, so...

52
00:02:52,525 --> 00:02:56,319
Anyway, pseudo's getting
harder and harder to come by.

53
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:58,770
I can hook you up
with some pseudo.

54
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:00,670
Major pseudo.

55
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,648
I got channels, bro.

56
00:03:03,294 --> 00:03:05,012
We could partner up.

57
00:03:07,055 --> 00:03:08,741
No pressure.
No pressure.

58
00:03:08,764 --> 00:03:10,931
Just think about it,
all right?

59
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,534
I gotta go.

60
00:03:23,197 --> 00:03:25,778
Yo, this way to savings!

61
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,246
Save your dollars bills, yo!

62
00:03:47,826 --> 00:03:50,826
"Grey Matter"

63
00:04:06,776 --> 00:04:08,207
It's a stupid gift.

64
00:04:08,264 --> 00:04:10,220
No, it isn't. He'll love it.

65
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:12,306
I don't know
what I was thinking.

66
00:04:12,408 --> 00:04:15,027
Didn't the invitation
even say "no gifts"?

67
00:04:15,102 --> 00:04:16,515
- Walt.
- What?

68
00:04:17,118 --> 00:04:18,607
We have to go.

69
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,281
I know.
I'm not complaing.

70
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:22,730
Yes, you are.

71
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:26,507
Look, we need this.

72
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,681
We've been through
a lot lately, okay?

73
00:04:33,476 --> 00:04:35,981
Guess we didn't get
the beige memo.

74
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:38,761
We're okay.

75
00:04:38,797 --> 00:04:42,551
Yes, I look like I'm wearing
a prom dress from 1985.

76
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:44,260
Honey, you look fine.

77
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:47,813
Walt, this is the only thing
I could find that fit me.

78
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,981
Would you look at that?
The invitation said "no gifts."

79
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:55,320
Oh, come on.

80
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:57,834
Sir, I'll take that
for you.

81
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,287
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

82
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:07,450
Oh, look,
there's Elliott.

83
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,390
Let's go say hello.

84
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:12,174
Elliott.

85
00:05:13,577 --> 00:05:15,517
Walt!
You made it.

86
00:05:17,462 --> 00:05:18,556
Happy birthday.

87
00:05:18,557 --> 00:05:21,595
- Wouldn't miss it for the world.
- Thank you. Skyler.

88
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:24,036
Oh, that's right.

89
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:26,631
Great to see you.
You look beautiful as always.

90
00:05:26,664 --> 00:05:30,032
Well, these days a little more
big than beautiful, but...

91
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,994
Of course!
Congratulations.

92
00:05:31,996 --> 00:05:33,495
That was such
great news.

93
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,540
Thank you.

94
00:05:34,545 --> 00:05:36,598
Gretchen, look who's here!

95
00:05:40,948 --> 00:05:42,708
It's been ages.

96
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,196
It's so good to see you.

97
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:47,847
It's... really good.

98
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,204
Skyler, welcome.
Congratulations.

99
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,659
Thank you.
It's really nice to be here.

100
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,141
When are you due?

101
00:05:54,144 --> 00:05:56,768
We're looking at
about ten more weeks.

102
00:05:56,953 --> 00:05:59,737
Actually, we recently
found out that it's a girl.

103
00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:02,575
- Congratulations.
- That's so wonderful.

104
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:05,276
We've been thinking
about it for ourselves.

105
00:06:05,305 --> 00:06:07,189
Yeah, thinking about it.

106
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:11,570
By the way,

107
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,772
securing that patent
was just amazing.

108
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:17,956
I mean, the work that
your company is doing...

109
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:20,741
Congratulations,
to both of you.

110
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,870
Hard work
and a lot of luck.

111
00:06:22,873 --> 00:06:25,068
- A lot of luck.
- Oh, well, no.

112
00:06:25,777 --> 00:06:28,282
Will you excuse us?
We gotta say hi.

113
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,381
Make yourselves at home.
We'll catch up later.

114
00:06:30,398 --> 00:06:31,905
Sure. Okay.

115
00:06:32,282 --> 00:06:34,656
- So good you're here.
- Thank you.

116
00:06:36,882 --> 00:06:37,994
Shall we?

117
00:07:57,022 --> 00:07:57,884
Walt?

118
00:07:58,196 --> 00:08:00,042
I thought that was you.

119
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:01,065
Farley!

120
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:02,625
Long time no see.

121
00:08:03,253 --> 00:08:05,071
This Walter White.

122
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,286
Back at Cal Tech,
he was...

123
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:10,079
you were just the master
of crystallography.

124
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:13,811
I remember this one time,
we were stuck on this protein problem...

125
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:15,944
for weeks!

126
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:18,223
You just breezed right in

127
00:08:18,243 --> 00:08:20,711
and you had
one word for us, too.

128
00:08:20,764 --> 00:08:23,533
Synchrotrons.
It was synchrotrons, yeah.

129
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:27,558
They generate purer and more
complete patterns than x-ray beams.

130
00:08:27,595 --> 00:08:30,465
Data collection takes
a fraction of the time.

131
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:33,404
This is the White
in Gray Matter.

132
00:08:34,624 --> 00:08:35,811
Tell 'em, Walt.

133
00:08:35,887 --> 00:08:37,272
Okay.

134
00:08:37,897 --> 00:08:40,717
Well, back when Elliott
and I were in grad school,

135
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,392
we came up
with the name.

136
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:45,778
Schwartz: black.
Walter White.

137
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:49,363
So, together they became
Gray Matter Technologies.

138
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,972
- Cute, huh?
- So you run the company with Elliott?

139
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:55,172
Well, no. No, that's
Gretchen and Elliott.

140
00:08:56,066 --> 00:08:58,207
I gravitated
toward education.

141
00:08:59,211 --> 00:09:00,619
What university?

142
00:09:05,136 --> 00:09:07,025
It's a Stratocaster!

143
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:09,200
Not just any Strat.

144
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,936
That's one of Clapton's.

145
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:12,160
No way.

146
00:09:12,948 --> 00:09:13,961
"To Elliott.

147
00:09:13,979 --> 00:09:17,615
"Sorry about the buckle rash.
Eric Clapton."

148
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:20,478
Thank you.
This is beautiful.

149
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:22,501
Why is he doing this?

150
00:09:22,802 --> 00:09:24,837
What is he,
like eight years old?

151
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,997
Here, honey.

152
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:30,893
Thanks.

153
00:09:31,052 --> 00:09:32,579
Oh, this is from Walt.

154
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:34,459
- God.
- It's okay!

155
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:47,979
Yum-Good Ramen.

156
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:01,822
This is what Walt and I...

157
00:10:03,127 --> 00:10:06,725
lived on for
10 months straight

158
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:09,570
while we were working
on our thesis.

159
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:12,939
They sold them down at Ralsto's
in the hardware aisle,

160
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:14,970
right next to the...
the what was it?

161
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:16,908
- Sterno.
- The Sterno.

162
00:10:17,523 --> 00:10:19,539
Yeah, 10 for $1.99.

163
00:10:19,644 --> 00:10:21,773
To this day,
I am convinced

164
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:24,969
these noodles were responsible
for our success.

165
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,064
This was our lifeblood.

166
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:28,984
Where'd you find these?

167
00:10:28,986 --> 00:10:31,705
I thought they'd been
outlawed years ago.

168
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,485
I love it.

169
00:10:37,132 --> 00:10:38,545
Thank you, Walt.

170
00:10:40,795 --> 00:10:43,037
For the man
who has everything.

171
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:45,261
- No, no.
- It was.

172
00:10:45,264 --> 00:10:47,573
You remember the fat guy,
the fat guy.

173
00:10:47,626 --> 00:10:49,265
We used to call him
"Snot Trough"

174
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:51,347
because he had
that thing under his n...

175
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:53,844
- What do you call that thing?
- That was Dobkins!

176
00:10:53,859 --> 00:10:56,862
That was the same guy who always
smelled like chocolate milk.

177
00:10:56,868 --> 00:10:58,937
- It was!
- No, no, no, no.

178
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,112
It wasn't Dobkins.
It was...

179
00:11:01,236 --> 00:11:05,179
Anyway, I swear to Christ
he used to iron those patches

180
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:08,965
onto the elbows of his
Members Only jacket because

181
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:11,031
he thought it made him
look more distinguished.

182
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,074
- Didn't it?
- No.

183
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:17,754
- Well, here's to Snot Trough.
- To Snot Trough.

184
00:11:17,756 --> 00:11:20,307
- Wherever you may be.
- God bless him.

185
00:11:22,156 --> 00:11:24,532
And you remember
the professor

186
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,177
who used to hate
Robert Wilhelm Bunsen?

187
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,425
Yes.

188
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:31,113
All you had to do was mention
the Bunsen burner

189
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:33,118
and he was off on a rant.

190
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,325
"No, he didn't invent it."
You remember the waving?

191
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,655
"He just improved it!"
You know.

192
00:11:39,176 --> 00:11:41,907
It was easy to kill
15 minutes anyway.

193
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:46,583
Oh God, I miss this, Walt.

194
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:49,459
Yeah. Me, too.

195
00:11:50,303 --> 00:11:53,109
Listen, we ought to
get together more often.

196
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,954
Skyler and I would love to have you
and Gretchen over for dinner sometime.

197
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,257
Sure, yeah, absolutely.

198
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:01,674
But what I mean is

199
00:12:01,682 --> 00:12:04,451
that you and I should
work together again.

200
00:12:07,202 --> 00:12:09,989
- Are you going to teach high school?
- No, no. Seriously.

201
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:11,772
What's stopping us?

202
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:17,543
Wait a minute.
Elliott, what are you...

203
00:12:17,906 --> 00:12:20,752
Are you asking me to come
work for you at Gray Matter?

204
00:12:20,851 --> 00:12:22,900
Yeah. Why not?
You'd fit right in.

205
00:12:22,902 --> 00:12:26,095
You're brilliant,
you've got a ton of experience.

206
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:27,646
Well, I...

207
00:12:28,086 --> 00:12:31,246
I wouldn't really know
where to begin. I mean...

208
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,117
God. You have no idea.

209
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:38,148
I spend my days just drawing out
atoms on the chalkboard

210
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:41,328
and trying to get these kids
to learn the periodic table.

211
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:42,929
Look, I understand.

212
00:12:42,953 --> 00:12:46,791
You're a little rusty,
but you're not seeing the upside here.

213
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,454
We could really benefit
from a new set of eyes.

214
00:12:50,863 --> 00:12:54,391
You know what it is when you been trying
to crack some problem for months on end.

215
00:12:54,392 --> 00:12:55,931
You get tunnel vision.

216
00:12:55,948 --> 00:12:58,024
One guy thinking
outside of the box...

217
00:12:58,035 --> 00:13:00,408
You may be exactly
what we need.

218
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,442
Well, listen, Elliott...

219
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,765
Your offer is very appealing.
It really is. I thank you. But...

220
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:29,547
There's something
you should know.

221
00:13:31,116 --> 00:13:33,197
I have some...

222
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,621
personal issues.

223
00:13:35,998 --> 00:13:38,692
Look, there's nothing
we can't work out.

224
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:43,010
Well, yeah,
but it's complicated.

225
00:13:44,686 --> 00:13:46,324
We can help you.

226
00:13:46,712 --> 00:13:49,292
We have excellent
health insurance.

227
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:53,386
The best.

228
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:18,449
Hey, did you try those prosciutto
wrapped figs? They were, like, wow!

229
00:14:18,464 --> 00:14:22,083
They were just... I must have had
about 30 of those suckers.

230
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,221
And the seafood table.
Did you see that?

231
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,108
They had lobster tail, they had
crab legs, there was, like, shrimp...

232
00:14:32,098 --> 00:14:32,894
Walt?

233
00:14:32,895 --> 00:14:35,387
What the hell
did you say to Elliott?

234
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:38,314
You told him about
the cancer, didn't you?

235
00:14:38,351 --> 00:14:39,462
Didn't you?

236
00:14:40,932 --> 00:14:42,439
I can't believe it.

237
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,398
Okay, we were talking.

238
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:48,048
He asked how you were doing,
and I am sorry,

239
00:14:48,057 --> 00:14:50,560
but I don't have
the best poker face these days

240
00:14:50,572 --> 00:14:52,305
where that's concerned.

241
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:55,962
He knew something was wrong
with you and he pressed me.

242
00:14:56,036 --> 00:14:57,776
He pressed you.
Come on.

243
00:14:57,789 --> 00:14:58,702
Walt!

244
00:14:59,021 --> 00:15:00,791
When it came
right down to it,

245
00:15:00,822 --> 00:15:03,217
I didn't know what else to do
but tell him the truth.

246
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:06,704
The truth? How about
you just said "he's fine," huh?

247
00:15:08,905 --> 00:15:10,891
Maybe you could've just
have said that?

248
00:15:10,924 --> 00:15:12,336
"He's fine," and done.

249
00:15:12,392 --> 00:15:14,317
I don't like the way
you're talking to me.

250
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,541
I don't like the way you talk
about my private affairs

251
00:15:17,592 --> 00:15:20,787
to people who are not
even in our lives anymore.

252
00:15:21,398 --> 00:15:24,957
- What exactly did he say to you?
- He offered me a job.

253
00:15:25,023 --> 00:15:26,549
- What?
- Yes.

254
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,039
Kind of like some
fig leaf, you know?

255
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,977
Some face-saving bullshit

256
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:35,241
that allowed me to generously
accept his charity.

257
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:38,042
And then, when I turned
that down, he flat-out

258
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:40,146
offered
to pay for my treatment.

259
00:15:40,164 --> 00:15:43,428
Which is exactly what you
expected him to do, didn't you?

260
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:45,317
- Didn't you?
- No.

261
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,199
- Please. Come on.
- I did not put him up...

262
00:15:51,026 --> 00:15:52,911
Okay, what did you say?

263
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:56,744
Walt?

264
00:15:57,877 --> 00:15:59,761
What do you think I said?

265
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:02,416
Why? Walt...

266
00:16:52,947 --> 00:16:55,754
- You ready to go?
- I'm taking the bus.

267
00:16:58,686 --> 00:16:59,816
Okay...

268
00:17:02,577 --> 00:17:03,877
Bye, honey.

269
00:17:42,577 --> 00:17:44,876
Hey, dude, are these
bullet holes?

270
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:50,443
No, man. Those are for,
like, you know,

271
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:52,119
ventilation.

272
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:53,980
Cool.

273
00:17:56,203 --> 00:17:57,936
Nice set-up, huh?

274
00:17:59,443 --> 00:18:01,569
- Man.
- This is nothing, man.

275
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,562
I used to have, like,
twice as much glassware

276
00:18:04,992 --> 00:18:08,980
until my dumbass ex-partner
drove us into a ditch

277
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:11,046
and wrecked most of it.

278
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,927
Big ass beaker, huh?

279
00:18:13,778 --> 00:18:17,357
Wait, wait. No, that's a...
Yeah, that's a boiling flask.

280
00:18:17,593 --> 00:18:19,477
This is a beaker.

281
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:23,054
Here's a Griffin beaker,
here's a volumetric beaker.

282
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:27,356
Here's an Erlenmeyer flask.

283
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:29,008
You got...

284
00:18:30,202 --> 00:18:32,011
You really know your shit.

285
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:34,859
Well, it's just
basic chemistry, yo.

286
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:39,212
So... you got
something for me?

287
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:41,105
Oh, hells, yeah!

288
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,840
Okay. We're in business.

289
00:18:56,573 --> 00:18:59,545
- Right on, Badger.
- Dude, check this out.

290
00:19:00,828 --> 00:19:03,383
Jesus, what the hell
are you bringing that for?

291
00:19:04,054 --> 00:19:05,203
Hunting.

292
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,941
We might see javelinas.

293
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:40,005
Are you going
to help me or what?

294
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:52,664
Badger!

295
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,998
Let me see the money.

296
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,402
Nah, I need five each.
Come on, two more.

297
00:20:57,413 --> 00:20:58,363
Here.

298
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:01,126
What about him?

299
00:21:02,106 --> 00:21:04,460
Are you kidding?
He looks younger than us.

300
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,671
Whatever.

301
00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:08,426
What about that guy?

302
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:11,442
- Nah, he looks like a businessman.
- So what?

303
00:21:11,527 --> 00:21:14,503
So, businessmen
are always in a hurry.

304
00:21:14,702 --> 00:21:17,980
They're always, like,
going to some meeting or something.

305
00:21:18,168 --> 00:21:20,655
Seriously, he's just
going to say no.

306
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,730
This guy.

307
00:21:23,743 --> 00:21:25,099
This is our guy.

308
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:26,423
You're up.

309
00:21:26,854 --> 00:21:28,615
Why do I have to do it?

310
00:21:28,671 --> 00:21:31,256
Give me the crutches
and I'll go do it.

311
00:21:36,643 --> 00:21:38,206
Excuse me, hey.

312
00:21:38,942 --> 00:21:41,216
We forgot our IDs
and we were wondering

313
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,441
if you could do us a favor
and buy us a six-pack.

314
00:21:45,232 --> 00:21:47,699
You know, what you're
asking is illegal.

315
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,499
No, it's not?

316
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:52,496
Yeah, it is.

317
00:21:57,532 --> 00:21:59,360
Guess you win the jackpot.

318
00:22:01,402 --> 00:22:03,982
This is not how I wanted
to spend my night off.

319
00:22:04,025 --> 00:22:06,391
Consider this your
first and last warning.

320
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:07,442
Yes, sir.

321
00:22:07,444 --> 00:22:09,944
You're lucky you got
a good dad here.

322
00:22:18,105 --> 00:22:20,255
If the other guys
hadn't run,

323
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:22,879
I could've talked
my way out of it.

324
00:22:23,277 --> 00:22:25,236
Not cool, man.
Not cool.

325
00:22:25,632 --> 00:22:29,060
What, you never tried to buy beer
when you were my age?

326
00:22:29,269 --> 00:22:32,453
No, I'm talking about you calling me
and not your father.

327
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:35,233
How do you think
that will make him feel?

328
00:22:44,965 --> 00:22:47,433
I don't even know
what to say to you.

329
00:22:49,705 --> 00:22:50,836
Just go.

330
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:54,218
I'll deal with you later.

331
00:23:01,243 --> 00:23:02,599
Where's Walt?

332
00:23:03,186 --> 00:23:05,381
I haven't seen him
since this morning.

333
00:23:05,393 --> 00:23:07,648
Your guess
is as good as mine.

334
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,177
Listen, do me a favor,
all right?

335
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,179
Don't tell him
about the kid.

336
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:15,557
Just a teenager trying
to score some beer, you know?

337
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,117
You know.
Just growing pains.

338
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:24,195
I mean, he finds out his dad's sick,
he starts acting out, you know?

339
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:26,772
First the pot,
and then this.

340
00:23:27,383 --> 00:23:28,607
The pot?

341
00:23:31,265 --> 00:23:34,306
- You told me he was smoking reefer.
- That's what Skyler told me.

342
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,110
I mean, you may as well have.

343
00:23:36,138 --> 00:23:38,824
I wasn't talking
about Walter, Jr.

344
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,526
I was talking about Walt.

345
00:23:44,268 --> 00:23:45,515
Excuse me?

346
00:23:46,786 --> 00:23:48,160
He admitted it.

347
00:23:50,157 --> 00:23:51,834
He said he liked it.

348
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,244
Walt?

349
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:06,986
I didn't think
he had it in him.

350
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:09,210
It's like he's not
himself lately.

351
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:12,307
I mean, why would anyone
in their right mind

352
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:14,090
choose not to do treatment?

353
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,822
Especially when
it's completely paid for?

354
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:19,026
Why is he doing this?

355
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,151
You know what
we need to do?

356
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:25,553
What we really need to do
is sit him down, all of us,

357
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,957
and get everything
out on the table.

358
00:24:27,995 --> 00:24:30,040
Talk it all through.

359
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,508
You mean an intervention?

360
00:24:32,546 --> 00:24:33,852
No, no.

361
00:24:33,985 --> 00:24:36,717
Just a family meeting...

362
00:24:37,395 --> 00:24:40,757
where everyone can
voice their concerns and...

363
00:24:41,087 --> 00:24:42,584
be heard.

364
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,835
You are a genius, bro!

365
00:24:52,967 --> 00:24:55,152
This cankenstein
is unreal!

366
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:57,861
When we get back,
I'm gonna burn that dollar bill suit

367
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:00,586
'cause we're gonna
make some mad dough!

368
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:03,479
It's not right.

369
00:25:04,376 --> 00:25:06,168
What do you mean
it's not right?

370
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,432
It's... cloudy.

371
00:25:09,436 --> 00:25:11,000
It's not supposed
to be cloudy.

372
00:25:11,058 --> 00:25:13,375
That last time,
it was glass.

373
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:15,273
So what?

374
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:18,818
Cloudy, not cloudy,
it looks good enough to me.

375
00:25:20,984 --> 00:25:22,378
"Good enough."

376
00:25:26,994 --> 00:25:28,945
Yo, what are you doing?

377
00:25:33,305 --> 00:25:36,234
Are you out of your mind?
I totally would've smoked that!

378
00:25:36,247 --> 00:25:38,275
It's not for you,
it's for our customers.

379
00:25:38,283 --> 00:25:40,800
They're gonna demand
a certain standard.

380
00:25:40,898 --> 00:25:41,784
What?

381
00:25:42,606 --> 00:25:44,754
What are you...
What?

382
00:25:45,036 --> 00:25:46,981
We'll just do it again...

383
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:48,846
until we get it right.

384
00:26:14,816 --> 00:26:15,741
Walt...

385
00:26:18,397 --> 00:26:20,921
Please have a seat
and join us.

386
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:13,541
We can do better.

387
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:15,855
Don't you fucking
think about it!

388
00:27:19,385 --> 00:27:21,567
Three entire pounds
of pseudo wasted!

389
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:23,903
You know how long I had
to spin that stupid sign?

390
00:27:23,905 --> 00:27:25,373
Get off me, psycho!

391
00:27:25,383 --> 00:27:26,992
Helicopter, bitch!

392
00:27:46,988 --> 00:27:48,344
Open the door!

393
00:28:09,651 --> 00:28:11,497
Come back here, you bitch!

394
00:28:12,745 --> 00:28:14,516
I'm gonna mess you up!

395
00:28:26,903 --> 00:28:30,095
I really need to understand
your thought

396
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,638
process because clearly I don't.

397
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:34,344
I feel

398
00:28:34,607 --> 00:28:37,753
that this decision
you've made

399
00:28:37,813 --> 00:28:40,219
is not only not
in your best interest,

400
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:43,811
it's not in the best interest
of our entire family.

401
00:28:44,228 --> 00:28:46,632
- Look, Skyler...
- Not yet. Please.

402
00:28:46,652 --> 00:28:49,345
I have the Talking Pillow.

403
00:28:52,053 --> 00:28:54,464
Everybody gets to speak
their minds, remember?

404
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,822
And then, you'll get
your chance.

405
00:28:58,135 --> 00:29:02,019
Money has always been an issue for us,
I'll give you that.

406
00:29:02,335 --> 00:29:05,062
But now that Elliott is more
than willing to pitch in,

407
00:29:05,072 --> 00:29:08,595
I know, I understand that it's hard
for you to accept help.

408
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:10,884
Maybe it's the way
you were raised.

409
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:12,244
But, honey...

410
00:29:13,148 --> 00:29:16,596
it's okay to lean
on people now and again.

411
00:29:17,153 --> 00:29:19,617
You need this treatment,

412
00:29:19,721 --> 00:29:22,581
and nothing can stop you
from getting it,

413
00:29:22,786 --> 00:29:24,218
except you.

414
00:29:31,989 --> 00:29:33,986
Am I allowed to respond?

415
00:29:34,104 --> 00:29:35,415
In a minute.

416
00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:38,479
I think we need to go
around the circle first.

417
00:29:41,292 --> 00:29:43,477
Hank, would you
like to start?

418
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,156
Yeah.
Okay.

419
00:29:49,675 --> 00:29:53,532
- Well, what I'll say is...
- No, take the Talking Pillow.

420
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,982
All right, look, buddy.

421
00:30:03,273 --> 00:30:06,796
I know I don't get to
tell you this enough, but...

422
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,159
I care...
about you...

423
00:30:11,871 --> 00:30:13,510
a hell of a lot.

424
00:30:14,158 --> 00:30:15,658
This cancer thing...

425
00:30:17,288 --> 00:30:18,739
Let's just...
Let's face it.

426
00:30:18,752 --> 00:30:21,169
You know, you were
dealt a shit hand.

427
00:30:21,357 --> 00:30:22,318
But...

428
00:30:23,242 --> 00:30:25,502
sometimes your
luck can change.

429
00:30:25,589 --> 00:30:28,936
I mean, I can't tell you how
many times I was, you know,

430
00:30:28,943 --> 00:30:32,882
I started with a shit hand
and I ended up with a full house.

431
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,108
Okay?

432
00:30:34,976 --> 00:30:37,242
I mean, the key is,
you gotta hang in there.

433
00:30:37,266 --> 00:30:40,774
Man, you gotta keep placing your bets.
Keep placing your bets.

434
00:30:42,813 --> 00:30:46,020
Hank... what the hell
are you saying?

435
00:30:46,067 --> 00:30:49,266
Please, Marie, let him talk.
That's what we're here to do.

436
00:30:49,277 --> 00:30:50,451
Please.

437
00:30:51,915 --> 00:30:53,177
Go on, Hank.

438
00:30:54,654 --> 00:30:56,008
Right, well...

439
00:30:56,776 --> 00:30:58,744
Look at it this way, okay?

440
00:30:58,981 --> 00:31:01,960
It's the bottom of the 9th.
Bases are loaded.

441
00:31:02,211 --> 00:31:03,624
You're up.

442
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:06,558
But you got a bum arm.
Right?

443
00:31:06,892 --> 00:31:10,095
There's no frickin' way
you're gonna hit a homer.

444
00:31:10,332 --> 00:31:13,817
So you can either let
the pinch hitter take the bat,

445
00:31:14,175 --> 00:31:17,721
or you can hold on to your pride
and lose the game.

446
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,230
Get what I'm saying?

447
00:31:21,677 --> 00:31:22,543
No.

448
00:31:25,866 --> 00:31:28,992
You got your pride, man.
I get it. Okay? I get it.

449
00:31:29,152 --> 00:31:32,976
If this Daddy Warbucks wants to chip in,
I'm with your old lady on this one.

450
00:31:32,977 --> 00:31:35,404
I say take the money
and run, you know.

451
00:31:39,218 --> 00:31:41,333
Somebody want to take this thing?
Here.

452
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:42,981
Yes, Walter...

453
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:46,551
Walter Jr.,
I'm sure you have about

454
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:50,923
a million things to say, probably,
and now is your chance.

455
00:31:52,351 --> 00:31:55,063
Go ahead.
Just let it all out.

456
00:31:58,508 --> 00:32:00,592
- This is bullshit.
- Hey, come on.

457
00:32:00,955 --> 00:32:01,929
It's all right.

458
00:32:06,712 --> 00:32:07,569
Talk.

459
00:32:08,724 --> 00:32:10,735
Tell your dad
how you feel.

460
00:32:14,156 --> 00:32:16,387
- I'm pissed off.
- Tell him.

461
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:19,459
I'm pissed off,

462
00:32:20,454 --> 00:32:22,153
'cause you're being...

463
00:32:23,554 --> 00:32:24,657
You're...

464
00:32:27,016 --> 00:32:28,736
You're a pussy.

465
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,256
You're, like,
ready to give up.

466
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:41,717
God. What if you gave
up on me, huh?

467
00:32:48,605 --> 00:32:52,225
This here? All the stuff
I've been through,

468
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:56,529
and you're scared
of a little chemotherapy?

469
00:33:11,645 --> 00:33:13,357
Me, personally?

470
00:33:16,243 --> 00:33:19,232
I think you should do
whatever you want to do.

471
00:33:20,687 --> 00:33:21,517
What?

472
00:33:22,926 --> 00:33:25,344
You told us to be
honest about our feelings.

473
00:33:25,345 --> 00:33:27,788
Walt's the one with cancer.
It's his decision.

474
00:33:27,793 --> 00:33:29,879
It's not up
to any of us.

475
00:33:30,028 --> 00:33:32,841
Why in the hell
would you do this?

476
00:33:34,797 --> 00:33:37,768
I wasn't planning
on agreeing with Walt.

477
00:33:37,881 --> 00:33:40,194
But after sitting here
and listening to you all

478
00:33:40,203 --> 00:33:42,534
talk about his future
like he has no say in it.

479
00:33:42,546 --> 00:33:44,730
He's not gonna
have a future

480
00:33:44,764 --> 00:33:46,694
if he doesn't
get treatment.

481
00:33:46,706 --> 00:33:49,734
I am a medical
professional.

482
00:33:50,165 --> 00:33:53,991
I x-ray people
in treatment every day.

483
00:33:54,011 --> 00:33:56,722
I see them every day,
and you know what?

484
00:33:56,869 --> 00:34:00,405
Some of them are
absolutely miserable.

485
00:34:00,431 --> 00:34:03,099
- Marie...
- I'm sorry, but it's true.

486
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,795
And some of them
don't wanna spend

487
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:08,458
their last weeks or months

488
00:34:08,482 --> 00:34:10,851
being picked at by doctors.

489
00:34:11,236 --> 00:34:13,695
But they got talked into it
by their families.

490
00:34:13,723 --> 00:34:16,280
Could I get the pillow back?
I agree with Marie on that.

491
00:34:17,031 --> 00:34:19,092
What? Maybe Walt wants
to die like a man.

492
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,603
I don't want him
to die at all!

493
00:34:22,032 --> 00:34:25,990
That's the whole point of this.
So either help, or leave!

494
00:34:26,034 --> 00:34:29,019
Skyler, I just wanted
to do you the courtesy

495
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,530
of giving you
my honest opinion.

496
00:34:31,621 --> 00:34:35,098
You know, Marie,
this is not debate club.

497
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,987
This is my husband's life.

498
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:40,917
- I make one simple observation...
- My husband's life we're talking about!

499
00:34:41,758 --> 00:34:44,145
- Ladies. Come on.
- How dare you...

500
00:34:48,777 --> 00:34:50,424
This is so stupid.

501
00:34:56,048 --> 00:34:58,925
All right, I've got
the Talking Pillow now.

502
00:34:59,468 --> 00:35:00,402
Okay?

503
00:35:11,389 --> 00:35:13,374
We all, in this room,

504
00:35:14,827 --> 00:35:16,397
we love each other.

505
00:35:17,232 --> 00:35:20,761
We want what's best
for each other, and I know that.

506
00:35:21,242 --> 00:35:23,577
I am very thankful for that.

507
00:35:25,096 --> 00:35:26,030
But...

508
00:35:27,096 --> 00:35:28,458
what I want...

509
00:35:31,156 --> 00:35:33,504
What I want,
what I need,

510
00:35:35,854 --> 00:35:37,359
is a choice.

511
00:35:38,938 --> 00:35:41,819
What does that... mean?

512
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,850
Sometimes, I feel like
I never actually

513
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,338
make any of my own.

514
00:35:52,992 --> 00:35:54,912
Choices, I mean.

515
00:36:01,652 --> 00:36:03,391
My entire life,

516
00:36:04,818 --> 00:36:06,738
it just seems I never...

517
00:36:09,927 --> 00:36:13,521
you know, had a real say
about any of it.

518
00:36:17,391 --> 00:36:19,856
Now this last one,
cancer...

519
00:36:22,435 --> 00:36:25,989
all I have left is how I choose
to approach this.

520
00:36:26,892 --> 00:36:29,240
Then make the
right choice, Walt.

521
00:36:30,725 --> 00:36:33,216
You're not the only
one it affects.

522
00:36:34,589 --> 00:36:36,559
What about your son?

523
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:41,224
Don't you wanna see your
daughter grow up? I just...

524
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,514
Of course, I do.

525
00:36:51,021 --> 00:36:54,511
Skyler, you've read
the statistics.

526
00:37:00,816 --> 00:37:02,451
These doctors...

527
00:37:02,801 --> 00:37:04,838
talking about surviving.

528
00:37:05,986 --> 00:37:07,814
One year, two years,

529
00:37:07,827 --> 00:37:10,395
like it's the only
thing that matters.

530
00:37:10,678 --> 00:37:13,377
But what good is it,
to just survive

531
00:37:13,388 --> 00:37:16,617
if I am too sick to work,

532
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,261
to enjoy a meal,

533
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:24,831
to make love?

534
00:37:32,195 --> 00:37:34,206
For what time I have left,

535
00:37:37,346 --> 00:37:39,663
I want to live
in my own house.

536
00:37:39,853 --> 00:37:42,681
I want to sleep
in my own bed.

537
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:46,463
I don't wanna choke down 30
or 40 pills every single day,

538
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:49,772
lose my hair,
and lie around,

539
00:37:50,298 --> 00:37:52,127
too tired to get up...

540
00:37:54,867 --> 00:37:58,175
and so nauseated that
I can't even move my head.

541
00:38:00,887 --> 00:38:04,727
And you
cleaning up after me?

542
00:38:07,865 --> 00:38:09,279
Me, with...

543
00:38:12,703 --> 00:38:16,277
some dead man,
some artificially alive,

544
00:38:17,949 --> 00:38:20,427
just marking time?

545
00:38:22,877 --> 00:38:23,954
No. No.

546
00:38:28,623 --> 00:38:31,205
And that's how
you would remember me.

547
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:39,594
That's the worst part.

548
00:38:42,923 --> 00:38:44,130
So...

549
00:38:44,571 --> 00:38:47,749
that is my thought
process, Skyler.

550
00:38:50,523 --> 00:38:51,807
I'm sorry.

551
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,762
I just...

552
00:38:57,567 --> 00:38:59,773
I choose not to do it.

553
00:40:55,601 --> 00:40:56,665
All right.

554
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:02,087
All right what?

555
00:41:05,932 --> 00:41:07,697
I'll do the treatment.

556
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,954
It's gonna be okay.

557
00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:11,680
The lady from
the billing office said

558
00:42:11,688 --> 00:42:14,303
they usually bill
the insurance company directly,

559
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:17,047
but since our HMO
is not paying for it,

560
00:42:17,178 --> 00:42:19,646
we can pay up front
with a credit card.

561
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:20,881
Good.

562
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:25,739
And then Elliott
will send a check.

563
00:42:27,085 --> 00:42:29,138
I will take care of it.

564
00:42:34,892 --> 00:42:36,267
Walter White?

565
00:42:37,217 --> 00:42:37,989
Yes.

566
00:42:41,152 --> 00:42:42,019
Okay.

567
00:42:45,014 --> 00:42:46,785
See you in a minute.

568
00:44:18,836 --> 00:44:19,834
Elliott.

569
00:44:20,487 --> 00:44:22,183
Walt, it's Gretchen.

570
00:44:24,155 --> 00:44:25,266
Oh, hey.

571
00:44:25,927 --> 00:44:27,773
Hey, Gretchen.
How are you?

572
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:31,389
You know, it was really great
seeing you two the other day.

573
00:44:32,449 --> 00:44:33,956
What a party.

574
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:37,959
Elliott told me
about the cancer.

575
00:44:39,028 --> 00:44:41,232
I'm so sorry.

576
00:44:44,017 --> 00:44:47,597
Well, you know,
it is what it is, I guess.

577
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:51,115
I don't know what
to say except

578
00:44:51,662 --> 00:44:53,885
I'm always here for you.

579
00:44:54,084 --> 00:44:57,042
Both of us are.
We wanted you to know that.

580
00:44:59,051 --> 00:45:00,803
Yeah, well, thank you.

581
00:45:02,892 --> 00:45:05,605
Walt, Elliott's told me

582
00:45:05,623 --> 00:45:07,925
he had offered to pay
for the treatment.

583
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:09,377
You have to accept.

584
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,069
That money, as far
as we're both concerned,

585
00:45:12,075 --> 00:45:14,094
that belongs to you.

586
00:45:14,188 --> 00:45:17,252
Even the name of our company,
it's half yours.

587
00:45:20,227 --> 00:45:21,094
Walt...

588
00:45:24,552 --> 00:45:26,605
Is this about
you and me?

589
00:45:39,761 --> 00:45:42,828
Gretchen, I really
appreciate the offer. I do.

590
00:45:43,746 --> 00:45:45,232
But we're fine.

591
00:45:46,754 --> 00:45:50,472
As it turns out, the insurance
came through after all.

592
00:45:50,513 --> 00:45:53,753
So... I am covered.

593
00:45:56,397 --> 00:46:00,147
Well, anyway,
I really appreciate it. Thank you.

594
00:46:02,022 --> 00:46:03,981
Good, that's good news.

595
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,992
You know, that really
was a great party.

596
00:46:12,384 --> 00:46:14,042
Keep in touch, okay?

597
00:46:14,269 --> 00:46:15,701
Sure. Sure.

598
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,038
Thank you for calling.

599
00:47:18,134 --> 00:47:19,832
You wanna cook?

Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:02,893 --> 00:00:03,999
Are you moving back in?

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,174
Yes.

4
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:08,272
Do you really think
that's... that's a good idea?

5
00:00:08,386 --> 00:00:10,287
A list of names.
They trace back to Madrigal

6
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:11,733
and they're gonna get
picked up by the police.

7
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:14,110
Outstanding work, Hank.
If only we had listened.

8
00:00:14,252 --> 00:00:15,781
It's not right to put
this on you.

9
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:18,060
Shut up! Shut up!

10
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,889
Breakdown?
What does that mean?

11
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:21,940
It means I don't know
what else to call it.

12
00:00:22,263 --> 00:00:23,486
You do know, right?

13
00:00:23,578 --> 00:00:25,130
She was having an affair.

14
00:00:25,616 --> 00:00:27,656
Can you still get your
hands on methylamine?

15
00:00:27,793 --> 00:00:29,652
Maybe.
Why?

16
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:32,912
I gotta say,
when you first brought her in,

17
00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:34,446
I had my doubts.

18
00:00:34,447 --> 00:00:37,949
But your little darling's
got nine lives.

19
00:00:41,153 --> 00:00:45,023
Rear-wheel assembly took the
brunt of the impact, so, uh...

20
00:00:45,057 --> 00:00:46,424
Yeah.

21
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,227
CV shaft, boots,
joints, axle--

22
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:51,594
Replaced all of it.
No way around it.

23
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,497
I went after market
on most of the parts here.

24
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:57,134
You want me to swap in
factory parts, that's fine.

25
00:00:57,168 --> 00:00:59,869
But using after-market's the only
way we'll keep it under blue book

26
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:03,140
and on the insurance company's
dime, okay?

27
00:01:03,174 --> 00:01:05,142
Nothing beats free.

28
00:01:05,176 --> 00:01:07,743
Uh, swapped out
your air filter,

29
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:10,246
topped off your fluids.

30
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,699
Didn't have to replace
the windshield this time.

31
00:01:12,832 --> 00:01:14,159
I know, right?

32
00:01:14,484 --> 00:01:16,285
Oh, and I noticed you had

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,487
some sort of gunky buildup

34
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:20,489
in the front end here.

35
00:01:20,523 --> 00:01:23,291
First, I had no idea
what I was looking at.

36
00:01:23,326 --> 00:01:25,093
Then I remembered
that you had me replace

37
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,177
that front fender
a few months back

38
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:29,027
when you ran over that deer.

39
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,466
We went at it
with the steam hose,

40
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,301
cleaned it up for you.

41
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:36,637
Hardest part was the paint.

42
00:01:36,672 --> 00:01:39,506
Fern green.
Interesting tint.

43
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,241
Anything else?

44
00:01:41,276 --> 00:01:44,378
That's it.
Zero balance, like I said.

45
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:47,448
Sign here, you're good to go.

46

People like to joke,

47
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:56,089
but I really, really like this car.
She's * hell.

48
00:01:56,123 --> 00:01:59,492
I'm betting you get another
200,000 miles out of her.

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,750
What would you give me for it?

52
00:02:26,784 --> 00:02:28,486
What's the blue book, you mean?

53
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,523
No. I mean, what will
you pay me for this car?

54
00:02:32,557 --> 00:02:35,192
Well, I'm not
really looking for--

55
00:02:35,227 --> 00:02:37,561
$100?

56

Fifty?

57
00:02:39,197 --> 00:02:42,065
Insurance company just shelled
out 1,900 for the parts alone.

58
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:44,067
Then it's a bargain.

59
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:47,470
You give me 50 bucks,
and she's all yours.

60

You sure about this?

61
00:02:49,407 --> 00:02:50,740
Sure as shooting.

62
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:53,910

barge into my office,

00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:11,074
Mmm. Holly, too?

165
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:13,710
Where are we sending
our eight-month-old?

166
00:11:13,744 --> 00:11:17,414
Peace corps?

167
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:19,448
No. I just...

168
00:11:22,186 --> 00:11:24,153
A new environment

169
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:26,422
might be good for them.

170
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:28,457
What does that mean?

171
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,076
What's wrong with
their environment?

172
00:11:35,665 --> 00:11:37,165
Skyler...

173
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:42,204
What's wrong
with their environment?

174
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:46,808
Nothing.

175
00:11:53,915 --> 00:11:55,249
Hey.

176
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,000
Listen, I know these
last few weeks

177
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:02,089
have been rough.

178
00:12:02,123 --> 00:12:03,757
The threat to Hank

179
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,559
and this whole thing
with Beneke.

180
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,563
But there's absolutely nothing

181
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:13,266
for you to be afraid of
anymore, okay?

182
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,268
I mean, clear sailing
from here on out.

183
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,169
I promise.

184
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,507
You know, I want us to try

185
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:24,610
and start looking forward
to things again.

186
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,580
Speaking of which, my birthday.

187
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,115
Hmm?

188
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,617
I don't know--

189
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,619
I don't know
what you have planned,

190
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:37,556
and with everything
that's been going on lately,

191
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,990
I'd understand if you haven't
even given it a thought.

192
00:12:39,991 --> 00:12:43,000
But I think

193
00:12:43,194 --> 00:12:46,163
a little celebration
might be good.

194
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:48,399
For all of us.

195
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:52,770
You know, a birthday party.

196
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:56,172
What do you think?

197
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,976
Yeah?

198
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,578
Okay.

199
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:04,748
And maybe, if I may be so bold,

200
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:08,241
chocolate cake
with chocolate icing?

201
00:13:13,456 --> 00:13:15,824
Life is good, Skyler.

202
00:13:18,328 --> 00:13:19,961
Ohh...

203
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:34,035
[Walt]
Mmm. Thank you.

204
00:13:34,286 --> 00:13:36,250
Hey, mom, you forgot something.

205
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:38,680
- Hmm?
- Dad's bacon.

206
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:40,582
That's okay.
I can do it.

207
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:42,617
No. Mom has to.

208
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:48,223
Well, it is
sort of a tradition.

209
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:54,895
Watch this, Holly.
[Chuckling]

210
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,330
Watch what she does with bacon.

211
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:59,800
Watch it. Watch it.

212
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:02,603
[Walter, Jr. chuckling]
What is she doing?

213
00:14:02,637 --> 00:14:05,939
What is she doing?
Hmm?

214
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:11,778
That's a pretty small "1."

215
00:14:11,812 --> 00:14:13,780
Kind of is.

216
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:16,783
Just a little.
[Chuckling]

217
00:14:18,386 --> 00:14:20,687
Ah, now you're talking.

218
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:23,155
- No. No.
- Good move.

219
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,923
- No.
- No, no, no. It's good.

220
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,925
Very good.
Family teamwork.

221
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,228
Making sacrifices.
Very important.

222
00:14:29,262 --> 00:14:31,530
- Happy birthday, dad.
- Thank you, buddy.

223

[Holly cooing] You want some?

224

[Hank] Guy's some piece
of work, isn't he?

225
00:14:35,502 --> 00:14:37,302
Six feet under
and half a face--

226
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,137
he's still screwing with us.

227
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:41,573
So, what's next?

228
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:43,641
Oh, I don't know.

229
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:46,010
This Madrigal thing seems
hinky, though, you know?

230
00:14:46,044 --> 00:14:49,547
We got Burgermeister Meisterburger
over here in Germany,

231
00:14:49,582 --> 00:14:52,283
and 5,000 miles away,
you got this guy.

232
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:54,284
There's gotta be someone
in the middle, you know?

233
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:56,420
Someone we're missing.

234
00:14:58,256 --> 00:15:02,325
What about that, uh,
Lydia what's-her-name?

235
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,160
You know, lady banjo eyes
at the warehouse?

236
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,529
In this world?
No way.

237
00:15:06,563 --> 00:15:08,164
Too uptight.
Too together.

238
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,566
Maybe.

239
00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:12,869
She was wearing
mismatched shoes.

240
00:15:12,903 --> 00:15:15,171
How together can she be?

241
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,873
[Exhales forcefully]

242
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:21,677
Gentlemen,
how goes it with Fring?

243
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:25,214
You know, just, uh,
working through the grief.

244
00:15:25,249 --> 00:15:28,284
How soon before
you submit a final?

245
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:31,254
Well, we've been
kicking around some ideas.

246
00:15:31,288 --> 00:15:33,288
Had you asked me that
a couple of weeks ago,

247
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:36,491
- I'd have said this was
just a mop-up job, but... - But?

248
00:15:36,526 --> 00:15:39,161
Well, no one on Fring's crew
is talking to us.

249
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:41,396
I mean, not a peep,
no matter how hard we squeeze.

250
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,965
Which makes it likely there's somebody
out there keeping them in line.

251
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:47,569
Our money is on this guy--
Michael Ehrmantraut.

252
00:15:47,603 --> 00:15:50,671
He's Fring's head
of "corporate" security.

253
00:15:50,705 --> 00:15:53,674
- He's a definite hard case.
- Now, we're gonna stay on him.

254
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,177
We're putting together a
surveillance team as we speak.

255
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:58,312
Okay?
The other thing is--

256
00:15:58,346 --> 00:16:03,284
This may be unrelated, but the blue meth
is... is making a bit of a * back.

257
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:06,452
- Tell him, Gomie. - Yeah. Some small
amounts on the street-side pulls.

258
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:08,521
Lab's telling us
it's the same stuff.

259
00:16:08,556 --> 00:16:10,756
I mean, it could be
old inventory leaking out,

260
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:14,294
or it could be
somebody's rebooting,

261
00:16:14,328 --> 00:16:18,231
using Fring's former cooks
to set up a new operation.

262
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:19,932
I thought we had
Fring's cooks--

263
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:21,966
the unsubs in the lab fire.

264
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:24,969
Thought maybe one of them
was your Heisenberg.

265
00:16:25,004 --> 00:16:28,340
Yeah. Maybe.
I don't know.

266
00:16:28,374 --> 00:16:31,476
Like I said,
there's still a lot of questions.

267
00:16:32,945 --> 00:16:35,447
Agent Gomez,
could you give us a moment?

268
00:16:39,918 --> 00:16:42,119
Hank, I gotta say,

269
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,489
your work here
has been stellar.

270
00:16:45,524 --> 00:16:47,491
Really first rate.

271
00:16:47,526 --> 00:16:49,327
Thank you, sir.

272
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:52,630
So much so that I'm wondering
if it's time you made a change.

273
00:16:52,664 --> 00:16:55,965
You know, I have to
get back to El Paso.

274
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:58,568
This office needs an ASAC,

275
00:16:58,603 --> 00:17:01,003
and I'm thinking we should be
promoting from within.

276
00:17:01,038 --> 00:17:03,172
If you were to put in
an application,

277
00:17:03,207 --> 00:17:06,610
and I recommend that you do,
you will get the job.

278
00:17:06,644 --> 00:17:08,845
I have no doubt this DO
would be well served

279
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:11,413
with you at the helm.

280
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:14,283
Wow. That's, uh...

281
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:17,353
I'm not sure what to say.

282
00:17:17,387 --> 00:17:19,355
It's a big step up.

283
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:21,123
It's not without its headaches.

284
00:17:21,157 --> 00:17:22,924
Politics may take
some getting used to.

285
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,360
Plus, you'd be overseeing
every case in the office,

286
00:17:25,394 --> 00:17:27,262
so you'd need to reassign
all your day-to-days,

287
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,796
Fring included.

288
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,733
Much as I hate losing
a good field man,

289
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:34,302
that's the job,
and you need to be okay with it.

290
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:37,838
What do you say, Hank?

291
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:41,142
You want it?

292
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:44,311
Well,

293
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:46,713

murder me if I said "no"...

00:18:04,964 --> 00:18:07,333
finish up for me?

- Yeah.

00:19:57,104 --> 00:19:59,238
No! What--
No! I am!

325
00:19:59,273 --> 00:20:01,507
- Baby, I'm so proud of you.
- Yeah, yeah, okay, okay...

326
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:04,343
- Sorry, sorry.
- I believe you. Just don't kill us here.

327
00:20:05,812 --> 00:20:07,779
[Sighs]

328
00:20:07,813 --> 00:20:11,116
Marie, you've been moping
around the last few days.

329
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:14,319
Marie?

330
00:20:16,588 --> 00:20:19,090
What's up?

331
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,626
- Marie, come on.
- I'm sorry. I...

332
00:20:22,627 --> 00:20:24,628
I made a promise to someone.

333
00:20:26,631 --> 00:20:28,265
To who?

334
00:20:30,501 --> 00:20:32,903
- Who?
- Your brother-in-law.

335
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:37,408
Are you gonna give me
a hint at least?

336
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:40,276
It involves infidelity.
That's all I'm gonna say.

337
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,549
Oh, shit.
I knew it.

338
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:51,087
Knew what? What did you--
What did you know?

339
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:54,689
Well, I mean, I didn't know it,
but I've been saying it forever.

340
00:20:54,723 --> 00:20:56,925
Walt's second cell phone,
you know?

341
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,361
Sorry, babe, but I was way
ahead of you on this one.

342
00:21:01,097 --> 00:21:03,898
Way ahead of me.
Oh.

343
00:21:05,768 --> 00:21:08,270
Well, it wasn't Walt.

344
00:21:11,706 --> 00:21:13,374
Skyler?

345
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:19,113
No way.

346
00:21:24,386 --> 00:21:25,353
Hey.

347
00:21:25,387 --> 00:21:28,188
- Hey! There she is!
- Hey! Hi!

348
00:21:28,222 --> 00:21:30,123
- Hey!
- Hey!

349
00:21:30,157 --> 00:21:32,492
- Hey, buddy. Yeah.
- Welcome. Welcome.

350
00:21:32,493 --> 00:21:34,493
Happy birthday!

351
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:38,331
I'm in the center lane
going about 60,

352
00:21:38,366 --> 00:21:41,301
and I had no choice but just
tear butt out of there.

353
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:43,668
Just bwaaa!
So sweet.

354
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:45,737
Yeah, you know, highway patrol's
gonna be sweet on it too.

355
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,672
Gonna get their ticket quota
in a month.

356
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:49,541
You'll help me out,
right, Uncle Hank,

357
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,543
now that you run the DEA?

358
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:54,779
Oh, yeah. For my spoiled brat
car wash millionaire nephew?

359
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,516
Sure. I'll make sure you get
a cell with a view.

360
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,616
[Laughter]

361
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,251
All right.

362
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:03,087
- Well, I'm outta here.
- Okay.

363
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:05,156
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you, buddy.

364
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:09,427
- Congratulations again, Uncle Hank.
- Thanks.

365
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,396
- I'll see y'all later.
[Walt] - All right.

366
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,031
- All right. Have fun.
- Bye, drive safe.

367
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,125
- Drive safely, okay?
- I do.

368
00:22:15,258 --> 00:22:17,467
- Slow down.
- Never.

369
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,877
A hell of a couple cars
there, Walt.

370
00:22:27,912 --> 00:22:30,046
Honey, for my next birthday,

371
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,847
I'm gonna take
a page here from Walt

372
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:34,150
and buy myself a jet plane.

373
00:22:34,184 --> 00:22:36,852
[Walt] Well, maybe
I over did it a little.

374
00:22:36,886 --> 00:22:38,787
But with these
new lease rates--

375
00:22:38,821 --> 00:22:41,424
I mean,
they're mighty attractive.

376
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:52,300
Great dinner, Skyler.

377
00:22:52,334 --> 00:22:55,770
Those were some bad-ass
whipped potatoes, I tell you.

378
00:22:55,804 --> 00:22:58,239
You have to tell me
how you get all the lumps out.

379
00:22:58,274 --> 00:22:59,574
How do you do that?

380
00:22:59,608 --> 00:23:04,062
- A potato ricer.
- A ricer?

381
00:23:04,145 --> 00:23:06,746
You don't hand mash?

382
00:23:07,949 --> 00:23:09,683
No.

383
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:20,993
- Well, uh...
- Boy, it has...

384
00:23:21,027 --> 00:23:24,029
It has been quite a year, huh?
[Chuckles]

385
00:23:24,064 --> 00:23:26,031
Do you know that, uh,

386
00:23:26,066 --> 00:23:29,368
it's almost exactly a year ago

387
00:23:29,403 --> 00:23:31,404
that I got my diagnosis?

388
00:23:31,438 --> 00:23:33,339
- Jesus. Yeah, right?
- Yeah.

389
00:23:33,373 --> 00:23:36,308
- Seems like longer, doesn't it?
- Yeah. No. It's, uh...

390
00:23:38,111 --> 00:23:39,811
One year ago tomorrow.

391
00:23:39,845 --> 00:23:42,547
Day after my 50th.

392
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:46,947
Honestly, I never thought
I'd make it this far.

393
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:51,322
The cancer and surgery

394
00:23:51,356 --> 00:23:53,957
and Hank being shot--

395
00:23:53,992 --> 00:23:55,759
It's just...

396
00:23:55,793 --> 00:23:58,229
So many dark days.

397
00:23:58,263 --> 00:24:00,364
Well...
[Chuckles]

398
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:03,501
There's Marie's talking pillow.

399
00:24:03,535 --> 00:24:06,369
Remember that?
[Chuckling]

400
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,070
It was...
[Mutters]

401
00:24:08,105 --> 00:24:11,274
Boy, I did not want
to get any treatment.

402
00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:17,947
I think I was too scared

403
00:24:17,981 --> 00:24:19,815
or too angry or...

404
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,152
I don't know.
I just wanted to quit.

405
00:24:24,354 --> 00:24:28,323
But you guys--
You got me through it somehow.

406
00:24:29,325 --> 00:24:31,326
Kept me going.

407
00:24:32,462 --> 00:24:36,331
And that happened again
and again and again.

408
00:24:36,366 --> 00:24:38,966
I mean, there were times

409
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,470
when I was sure I was done for.

410
00:24:42,504 --> 00:24:44,872
But then someone

411
00:24:44,906 --> 00:24:47,074
or something

412
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:51,512
would come through for me.

413
00:24:51,547 --> 00:24:54,414
God. And Skyler--
I can't--

414
00:24:54,448 --> 00:24:57,184
Honey, remember that
first week of chemotherapy?

415
00:24:57,218 --> 00:24:59,619
That night
on the bathroom floor?

416
00:24:59,654 --> 00:25:01,953
What you said to me?

417
00:25:03,954 --> 00:25:05,926
I was so sick.

418
00:25:05,992 --> 00:25:09,361
It was rough going at first.

419
00:25:09,396 --> 00:25:11,463
But Skyler--

420
00:25:11,498 --> 00:25:13,899
She was right there, of course,

421
00:25:13,933 --> 00:25:16,868
putting wet washcloths
on my forehead.

422
00:25:16,903 --> 00:25:18,969
And she's singing to me.

423
00:25:19,004 --> 00:25:22,273
And this would go on and on,

424
00:25:22,308 --> 00:25:24,975
day after day.

425
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:28,646
And I remember I was lying
on the floor of the bathroom,

426
00:25:28,681 --> 00:25:33,350
because the tile felt
nice and cool, you know?

427
00:25:33,384 --> 00:25:36,353
And my head
was in Skyler's lap,

428
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:39,590
and I was just asking her

429
00:25:39,624 --> 00:25:42,292
if this could all be over.

430
00:25:43,695 --> 00:25:47,997
It was too hard. It was...
I just wanted it to stop.

431
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,733
Skyler, isn't that freezing?

432
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,605
[Hank]
Whoa. Hey-o. Pool party.

433
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:58,874
What are you doing, Skyler?
[Chuckles]

434
00:25:58,908 --> 00:26:01,510
What is she doing?
Walt?

435
00:26:01,545 --> 00:26:04,547
Hey, uh, Sky,
maybe it's time to get out now.

436
00:26:04,581 --> 00:26:05,913
What do you think?

437
00:26:05,948 --> 00:26:08,049
Skyler, Hank asked you
a question.

438
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:11,753
You need to get out n--
Skyler!

439
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:14,088
She's gonna come up, right?

440
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:15,539
She has to.

441
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:26,099
[Muffled] Skyler, you need to get out.
[Water splashes]

442
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,100
Oh, my God.

443
00:26:40,135 --> 00:26:42,769
Wha-- Okay.

444
00:26:42,803 --> 00:26:45,705
Okay. It's gotta be...

445
00:26:49,244 --> 00:26:51,378
Nope.
[Beep]

446
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,214
[Switch clicks] Okay...

447
00:26:54,249 --> 00:26:57,216
Come on!
How am I supposed to...

448
00:26:57,251 --> 00:26:58,751
[Switch clicks]

449
00:27:10,564 --> 00:27:12,330
Hey.

450
00:27:12,365 --> 00:27:13,898
Wait.

451
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:16,901
Wait, wait.
Who are you?

452
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:19,771
I'm the-- I'm the guy.
So where's the--

453
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,773
Hold on. Hold on.

454
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,575
Who sent you?

455
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:26,678
Who sent me?
Who do you think?

456
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:31,382
- No. I'm asking you.
- Mike...

457
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,849
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

458
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:35,052
And this Mike person--

459
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,188
What's his last name?

460
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:40,791
Lady, I just got off a plane
from New Mexico,

461
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,560
and I got
a 900-mile drive back.

462
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,961
That's 14 hours
if I don't stop.

463
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:48,331
So, the sooner we do this,
the sooner it's done.

464
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:55,638
Uh, Ehrmantraut.

465
00:27:55,672 --> 00:27:58,341
Okay? Satisfied?

466
00:28:02,078 --> 00:28:05,380
Sorry, but I'm not gonna
apologize for being careful.

467
00:28:05,415 --> 00:28:07,382
With all that's been happening
around here, for all I knew,

468
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:09,585
you were one of those undercover
people they send into high schools.

469
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:13,655
So, yeah, I'll take paranoid any day if
we're getting ganged by prison guards.

470
00:28:13,689 --> 00:28:15,690
Oh, no doubt.

471
00:28:15,725 --> 00:28:17,458
So, uh,
where's the--

472
00:28:17,493 --> 00:28:19,994
Up there.
Number 22356.

473
00:28:20,028 --> 00:28:22,130
That's the one I erased
from the inventory,

474
00:28:22,164 --> 00:28:24,165
so it has to be that one.

475
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:28,102
- Can you reach it?
- With a forklift.

476
00:28:28,137 --> 00:28:29,803
You got one?

477
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:52,491
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait! Stop!

478
00:28:52,526 --> 00:28:54,993
[Liquid sloshes]

479
00:28:55,028 --> 00:28:57,596
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

480
00:28:57,631 --> 00:28:59,097
What?

481
00:28:59,132 --> 00:29:02,201
Please tell me that's
not what I think it is.

482
00:29:20,085 --> 00:29:22,919
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

483
00:29:22,953 --> 00:29:25,489
No. No, of course not.

484
00:29:27,258 --> 00:29:29,326
[Sighs] No, no.

485
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,361
I just...

486
00:29:36,866 --> 00:29:41,904
She and I are
having some issues.

487
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:45,608
Yeah, yeah. I, uh--
I might've heard

488
00:29:45,642 --> 00:29:47,643
a little bit about that.

489
00:29:47,678 --> 00:29:50,913
I mean, hey, look,
Marie didn't go into detail.

490
00:29:50,947 --> 00:29:52,914
You know, said that,

491
00:29:52,948 --> 00:29:55,183
you know, you guys were...

492
00:29:55,218 --> 00:29:58,119
having some issues.

493
00:30:00,556 --> 00:30:04,659
So, uh, what's the next move?

494
00:30:04,694 --> 00:30:07,995
It may be good to have
her talk to someone.

495
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,997
- Oh, I agree.
- Yeah.

496
00:30:11,032 --> 00:30:12,866
Well, I'm gonna
get on that first thing.

497
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,201
Yeah.

498
00:30:14,236 --> 00:30:16,737
There's Marie's guy, Dave.

499
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:19,906
She seems really happy
with him.

500
00:30:19,941 --> 00:30:21,908
Not that Marie's
an advertisement

501
00:30:21,943 --> 00:30:24,510
for advanced mental health
or anything.

502
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,313
You know...

503
00:30:27,348 --> 00:30:31,516
I just had no idea
she was taking it this hard.

504
00:30:35,988 --> 00:30:37,989
Some birthday, huh?

505
00:30:47,932 --> 00:30:50,100
She's gonna try
and get some sleep.

506
00:30:50,135 --> 00:30:52,136
Oh, okay.

507
00:30:57,876 --> 00:30:59,343
What was that?

508
00:30:59,378 --> 00:31:03,580
- I don't know.
- I mean, was she trying...?

509
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:05,782
No, not in
a swimming pool. No.

510
00:31:05,816 --> 00:31:08,418
With all of us there?
No, I don't think so.

511
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:09,452
[Sniffling]

512
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:13,055
But, uh, we both, uh,

513
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:15,392
think that...

514
00:31:15,426 --> 00:31:18,795
she should talk to someone.

515
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:22,164
I'm gonna get you
Dave's number.

516
00:31:22,198 --> 00:31:23,766
Okay.

517
00:31:26,703 --> 00:31:29,471
Listen, Walt, I--

518
00:31:29,506 --> 00:31:32,073
I can't help but sense

519
00:31:32,108 --> 00:31:34,476
that there may be some issues

520
00:31:34,511 --> 00:31:36,444
between you and Skyler.

521
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,546
None of our business,
of course.

522
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,349
And, Hank, I don't know if you

523
00:31:41,383 --> 00:31:43,785
- picked up on any of--
- He knows--

524
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,187
He knows I know.

525
00:31:53,961 --> 00:31:56,996
These things happen
in a marriage,

526
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,612
but it isn't unfixable.

527
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:04,504
I think what would
be great is if

528
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:07,640
you two had some space

529
00:32:07,674 --> 00:32:11,076
to work through this stuff.

530
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,611
So--

531
00:32:12,646 --> 00:32:16,782
And keep an open mind here.

532
00:32:16,817 --> 00:32:19,952
What if we took the kids
for a while?

533
00:32:20,954 --> 00:32:23,322
- Took the kids?
- Absolutely.

534
00:32:23,356 --> 00:32:27,492
We'll look after them for a
day or two, or however long,

535
00:32:27,526 --> 00:32:30,862
and leave you and Skyler

536
00:32:30,896 --> 00:32:33,164
to look after each other.

537
00:32:33,198 --> 00:32:35,633
Uh, that's very generous
of you, Marie,

538
00:32:35,668 --> 00:32:40,203
but I-- I just don't see
how that's a solution.

539
00:32:40,238 --> 00:32:42,005
And-- I mean--

540
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:46,209
Besides, Junior and Holly--
That's a lot of work.

541
00:32:46,244 --> 00:32:48,011
No, it isn't.

542
00:32:48,045 --> 00:32:50,013
Junior's independent,

543
00:32:50,047 --> 00:32:53,450
and my niece
is only the easiest,

544
00:32:53,485 --> 00:32:56,619
most delicious baby
that was ever born.

545
00:32:56,653 --> 00:32:58,788
- It'll be fun, right?
- Yeah. Yeah. No, yeah.

546
00:32:58,822 --> 00:32:59,789
Yeah.

547
00:32:59,823 --> 00:33:01,791
Absolutely. Yeah.

548
00:33:01,825 --> 00:33:03,459
It's a good idea.

549
00:33:03,494 --> 00:33:05,828
I think it's a great idea.

550
00:33:05,863 --> 00:33:09,832
Just the thing for both of you.

551
00:33:15,337 --> 00:33:17,906
Marie,

552
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,382
this idea--

553
00:33:21,717 --> 00:33:22,976
was it yours?

554
00:33:23,078 --> 00:33:25,847
Actually, it was Skyler's.

555
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:31,519
Uh-huh.

556
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:34,288
She really needs this, Walt.

557
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:38,225
Yep.

558
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:49,436
I gave Marie bottles.

559
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,039
They'll stop and pick up
diapers on their way.

560
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:56,175
I spoke with Junior
on the phone,

561
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:58,377
and after much discussion,

562
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:00,879
he agreed to swing by tomorrow,
pick up some clothes.

563
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:05,651
And so, voila, the kids
are out of this environment.

564
00:34:05,685 --> 00:34:08,654
What a coincidence.

565
00:34:08,688 --> 00:34:11,423
I know you're awake.

566
00:34:15,361 --> 00:34:19,464
What was that about?
Can you explain it?

567
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:24,735
I don't want the children
here anymore.

568
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,771
It isn't safe.

569
00:34:26,805 --> 00:34:31,775
Skyler, we have talked
about this repeatedly.

570
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:33,777
It has never been more safe.

571
00:34:33,811 --> 00:34:35,712
"Never been"?

572
00:34:35,746 --> 00:34:38,882
A couple weeks ago,
a man was coming to this house

573
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:41,351
to kill us,
to murder your entire family.

574
00:34:41,385 --> 00:34:44,020
You were in the crawlspace,
screaming.

575
00:34:44,054 --> 00:34:46,222
And I dealt with him.
It's over.

576
00:34:46,256 --> 00:34:47,723
It is not.

577
00:34:47,757 --> 00:34:50,092
You're right back
in the meth business again.

578
00:34:50,126 --> 00:34:53,496
This is different.
Now I'm running things.

579
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:56,431
So wait.
Now that you're in charge,

580
00:34:56,466 --> 00:35:00,127
it's what, it's gonna be smooth
sailing from here on out?

581
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,538
I don't see why not.

582
00:35:01,573 --> 00:35:05,507
I keep the work
at work, Skyler,

583
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:07,942
and nothing will ever impact
you or the kids.

584
00:35:07,977 --> 00:35:11,245
You don't know that.
You can't make that promise, Walt.

585
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:13,781
I can promise you
that Gus Fring is dead.

586
00:35:13,816 --> 00:35:16,183
And he was the threat.
He was the danger.

587
00:35:16,218 --> 00:35:18,820
I thought you were the danger.

588
00:35:26,327 --> 00:35:28,896
Is that what
your pool stunt was about?

589
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:31,598
Trying to protect
my children from me?

590
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:33,667
Not just you...

591
00:35:33,701 --> 00:35:35,868
There's blood on my hands too.

592
00:35:35,903 --> 00:35:38,638
What blood? Beneke?

593
00:35:38,672 --> 00:35:41,497
He's in the hospital
because of me.

594
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,782
- No.
- Because of what I did.

595
00:35:43,817 --> 00:35:45,745
Skyler, you can't beat
yourself up over this thing.

596
00:35:45,779 --> 00:35:48,581
Please. You didn't set out
to hurt anybody.

597
00:35:48,615 --> 00:35:51,083
You made a mistake,
and things got out of control,

598
00:35:51,117 --> 00:35:53,785
but you did what you had to do
to protect your family.

599
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:56,254
And I'm sorry.
That doesn't make you a bad person,

600
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,956
it makes you a human being.

601
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:01,526
Stop it, Walt.
Just stop.

602
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:04,062
I don't need to hear any
of your bullshit rationales.

603
00:36:04,096 --> 00:36:05,630
I'm in it now.

604
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:08,198
I'm compromised.
But I won't--

605
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:11,168
I will not have my children
living in a house

606
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,103
where dealing drugs

607
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,505
and hurting people
and killing people

608
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,175
is shrugged off
as "shit happens."

609
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,243
We're back at it?
Fine.

610
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:24,001
But the kids stay away,
and that's that.

611
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:26,074
That's that?
That's what?

612
00:36:26,182 --> 00:36:27,483
I got them out of this house.

613
00:36:27,517 --> 00:36:29,819
To a sleepover
at their aunt and uncle's?

614
00:36:29,853 --> 00:36:32,088
They spend a day or two,

615
00:36:32,122 --> 00:36:34,824
Junior stays up late watching
movies, and then what happens?

616
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:37,459
- We'll see.
- No, I'll tell you what happens.

617
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,249
They come home.
To this house.

618
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:41,396
To their parents who love them.

619
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,932
No. I will not let
our business endanger them.

620
00:36:43,967 --> 00:36:47,569
- How many times do I have to say
that they are not in-- - I said no.

621
00:36:47,604 --> 00:36:50,993
I swear to God,
I won't have them back here.

622
00:36:57,412 --> 00:37:00,247
What are you gonna do
to stop it?

623
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,625
Whatever it takes.
Everything in my power.

624
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,394
Like what? I mean, specificly.

625
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:09,957
What is your next move?

626
00:37:09,992 --> 00:37:12,258
My next move
is maybe I hurt myself.

627
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:14,393
Make it clear
we need more time.

628
00:37:14,428 --> 00:37:16,963
Let Hank and Marie see
we're still struggling.

629
00:37:16,998 --> 00:37:18,598
No, more like
you're still struggling.

630
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:21,034
So maybe next time,
I have you committed.

631
00:37:21,068 --> 00:37:23,670
Put you in some
inpatient facility

632
00:37:23,704 --> 00:37:25,505
while I take care
of the kids myself.

633
00:37:25,539 --> 00:37:27,507
Is that what you want?

634
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:31,076
So then maybe I show up
with bruises on my neck,

635
00:37:31,111 --> 00:37:33,078
give myself a black eye,

636
00:37:33,113 --> 00:37:34,813
say that you beat me

637
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:37,650
when you found out
about my lover.

638
00:37:39,485 --> 00:37:42,121
I see.

639
00:37:42,155 --> 00:37:44,455
So you want to involve Ted?

640
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:45,957
Oh, well, that'll be fun,

641
00:37:45,991 --> 00:37:48,492
bringing the police
up to speed on all of that.

642
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:51,428
But not as much fun as
telling your 16-year-old son

643
00:37:51,463 --> 00:37:54,298
that his father
is a wife-beater.

644
00:37:54,332 --> 00:37:56,834
Also not a very good plan.
What else you got?

645
00:37:56,869 --> 00:37:59,570
I could send Junior
away to school.

646
00:37:59,604 --> 00:38:01,880
Oh. Now here's
the conversation...

647
00:38:02,028 --> 00:38:05,148
"So, honey, I know you've
only got one year left in high school,

648
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:07,844
but I would love it so much
if you would drop everything,

649
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:11,048
leave all your friends behind, and
go to boarding school in Arizona."

650
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:13,583
You have any other ideas?
Because I'm not hearing

651
00:38:13,617 --> 00:38:15,642
a solution to your problem.

652
00:38:16,498 --> 00:38:18,831
How are you going
to save our kids

653
00:38:18,866 --> 00:38:20,589
from this terrible environment?

654
00:38:20,623 --> 00:38:22,391
- I--
- What are you gonna do?

655
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,859
Are you gonna run off
to France?

656
00:38:23,894 --> 00:38:25,661
Are you gonna close the
curtains, change the locks?

657
00:38:25,696 --> 00:38:27,663
This is a joke.
Come on, Skyler.

658
00:38:27,698 --> 00:38:31,167
You wanna take me on?
You wanna take away my children?

659
00:38:32,334 --> 00:38:35,303
- What's the plan?
- I don't know!

660
00:38:35,337 --> 00:38:37,939
This is the best
I could come up with, okay?

661
00:38:37,973 --> 00:38:41,009
I-- I will count
every minute

662
00:38:41,043 --> 00:38:42,677
that the kids
are away from here,

663
00:38:42,712 --> 00:38:44,612
away from you, as a victory.

664
00:38:44,646 --> 00:38:47,881
But you're right.

665
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:50,818
It's a bad plan.

666
00:38:50,852 --> 00:38:55,388
I don't have any
of your magic, Walt.

667
00:38:55,423 --> 00:38:57,091
I don't know what to do.

668
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:59,326
I'm a coward.

669
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,561
I-- I can't go
to the police.

670
00:39:01,596 --> 00:39:03,563
I can't stop
laundering your money.

671
00:39:03,598 --> 00:39:05,497
I can't keep you
out of this house.

672
00:39:05,532 --> 00:39:08,134
I can't even keep you
out of my bed.

673
00:39:09,636 --> 00:39:12,471
All I can do is wait.

674
00:39:12,505 --> 00:39:14,841
That's it.
That's the only good option.

675
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:16,375
Hold on,

676
00:39:16,409 --> 00:39:18,344
bide my time,

677
00:39:18,378 --> 00:39:20,045
and wait.

678
00:39:22,281 --> 00:39:25,316
Wait for what?
What are you waiting for?

679
00:39:26,786 --> 00:39:30,021
For the cancer to come back.

680
00:40:05,953 --> 00:40:08,921
[Buzzing]

681
00:40:17,797 --> 00:40:19,297
Yeah?

682
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:23,068
Okay. Okay.

683
00:40:23,102 --> 00:40:25,936
Just relax.
I'm coming.

684
00:40:38,684 --> 00:40:41,285
[Jesse] Look at that.
You tell me what that looks like.

685
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:43,354
If the DEA's tracking
her barrels,

686
00:40:43,388 --> 00:40:45,222
there goes
our precursor connection.

687
00:40:45,257 --> 00:40:47,724
That's done.
And I'm telling you these days,

688
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:50,660
chances of getting a new
methylamine hook-up is rare, man.

689
00:40:50,695 --> 00:40:52,729
It's like Bigfoot.
Like unicorn-rare.

690
00:40:52,764 --> 00:40:57,234
Kid, it's just--
You're giving me heartburn here.

691
00:40:57,269 --> 00:40:59,835
GPS on the bottom
of the barrel.

692
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,438
Why didn't they put it inside
where nobody would see it?

693
00:41:02,472 --> 00:41:04,307
Look, it's inside, it gets wet.

694
00:41:04,341 --> 00:41:06,609
They made these things
to put under cars.

695
00:41:06,643 --> 00:41:08,211
They can get wet.

696
00:41:08,245 --> 00:41:09,545
Huh.

697
00:41:09,579 --> 00:41:12,715
Even by cop standards
this is sloppy.

698
00:41:12,749 --> 00:41:14,216
And the other barrels--

699
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,684
They have trackers
on the outside too?

700
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:19,821
I don't know.
Probably.

701
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:22,857
- You didn't check any
of the other barrels? - No.

702
00:41:22,892 --> 00:41:25,327
But that's the only one we
could've taken, according to her.

703
00:41:25,361 --> 00:41:27,329
Once we spotted it,
she freaked out,

704
00:41:27,363 --> 00:41:30,398
I put the barrel back,
and we FO'd.

705
00:41:30,432 --> 00:41:32,366
Let me ask you something.

706
00:41:32,401 --> 00:41:34,501
The person
who spotted this--

707
00:41:34,536 --> 00:41:36,537
Was it you or was it her?

708
00:41:36,571 --> 00:41:39,106
Lydia.
She saw it first.

709
00:41:40,508 --> 00:41:42,009
Okay.

710
00:41:42,044 --> 00:41:43,844
She's dead.

711
00:41:43,878 --> 00:41:45,446
Wait, wait, wait.
What?

712
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,548
Lydia planted this thing,
not the cops.

713
00:41:48,582 --> 00:41:50,383
She's thinking
if she makes it look

714
00:41:50,418 --> 00:41:52,385
like her inventory's
being watched

715
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,388
that we'll leave her alone
and take our business elsewhere.

716
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:56,856
And she's right,

717
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,973
we will be taking
our business elsewhere,

718
00:42:00,103 --> 00:42:02,129
right after I leave her
alone in a ditch.

719
00:42:02,164 --> 00:42:04,529
But wait, hey, if the DEA's
not tracking her stuff,

720
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,631
that's a good thing, right?

721
00:42:06,666 --> 00:42:08,400
I mean, all we gotta do
is tell her to,

722
00:42:08,435 --> 00:42:10,469
you know, cut the crap
and keep the methylamine coming.

723
00:42:10,503 --> 00:42:12,571
You don't know
this woman like I do.

724
00:42:12,605 --> 00:42:15,874
I had a chance to deal with this
before, and I gave her a pass.

725
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,909
That's what I get
for being sexist.

726
00:42:17,944 --> 00:42:19,577
Now, if you'll excuse me...

727
00:42:19,611 --> 00:42:21,446
Mike, you can't just...

728
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,015
Look, that's our precursor.
We need her.

729
00:42:24,049 --> 00:42:27,685
Kid, if we have to ramp down
for a while, so be it.

730
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:31,122
It beats working with a lunatic
who's gonna get us arrested or killed.

731
00:42:31,156 --> 00:42:33,924
Look, she didn't seem crazy
to me, you know?

732
00:42:33,959 --> 00:42:35,726
She just seemed, like, uptight.

733
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,061
And now you're being sexist.

734
00:42:38,096 --> 00:42:40,664
Trust me, this woman
deserves to die

735
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:43,133
as much as any man
I've ever met.

736
00:42:43,167 --> 00:42:45,202
No. Wait!

737
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,037
Just wait.

738
00:42:47,038 --> 00:42:49,306
What if this really was
the cops, you know?

739
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:52,308
- And what if you're wrong about her?
- I'm not wrong.

740
00:42:52,342 --> 00:42:54,644
But what if you are?

741
00:42:54,678 --> 00:42:58,515
Jesse, your misgivings
have been duly noted.

742
00:42:58,549 --> 00:43:01,317
Now move away from me.

743
00:43:01,351 --> 00:43:03,452
No. This is
a voting thing.

744
00:43:03,487 --> 00:43:07,322
- I don't think so.
- I vote it's a voting thing.

745
00:43:07,356 --> 00:43:09,290
Mr. White,
weigh in here, would you?

746
00:43:09,325 --> 00:43:11,693
What do you think?

747
00:43:11,728 --> 00:43:14,462
Mr. White?

748
00:43:22,671 --> 00:43:26,106
The methylamine keeps flowing,
no matter what.

749
00:43:26,141 --> 00:43:29,276
We are not ramping down.

750
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:32,547
We're just getting started.

751
00:43:32,581 --> 00:43:35,883
Nothing stops this train.

752
00:43:35,918 --> 00:43:38,052
Nothing.

753
00:43:39,554 --> 00:43:42,589
Hey, yo, Mr. White.
Hold up.

754
00:43:44,158 --> 00:43:47,594
I just wanted to say
I liked your idea.

755
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:50,931
You know, it's pretty, uh...

756
00:43:50,965 --> 00:43:53,499
I think it's the way to go.

757
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,470
Oh, hey, um,

758
00:43:58,504 --> 00:44:02,007
you said it was your--
your birthday, so...

759
00:44:04,578 --> 00:44:06,545
I left the receipt in the box

760
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,014
in case you wanna exchange it.

761
00:44:10,149 --> 00:44:13,918
Anyway, hey, happy birthday.

762
00:44:29,401 --> 00:44:31,168
Hi.

763
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:41,378
I, uh, stopped by
Hank and Marie's.

764
00:44:41,413 --> 00:44:45,615
Junior is still asking,
"what is going on?"

765
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:48,384
Nonstop, very insistently.
[Chuckles]

766
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:50,720
But everything's okay.

767
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:54,090
They're watching <i>Ratatouille.</i>

768
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:56,192
It's very sweet.

769
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,995
How are you?

770
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:10,272
There's gonna be some more
money coming in soon.

771
00:45:10,306 --> 00:45:12,407
Is that okay?

772
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:15,610
Fine.

773
00:45:15,644 --> 00:45:17,278
Good.

774
00:45:20,048 --> 00:45:22,517
So...

775
00:45:22,551 --> 00:45:25,219
Are you coming to bed?

776
00:45:49,942 --> 00:45:51,943
I wanna show you something.

777
00:45:54,413 --> 00:45:56,614
See that watch?

778
00:45:56,649 --> 00:45:59,784
It's a birthday present.

779
00:45:59,818 --> 00:46:02,820
The person who gave me
this present

780
00:46:02,854 --> 00:46:05,490
wanted me dead too.

781
00:46:05,524 --> 00:46:07,892
Not that long ago,

782
00:46:07,926 --> 00:46:09,959
he pointed a gun
right between my eyes,

783
00:46:09,994 --> 00:46:11,695
right here,

784
00:46:11,729 --> 00:46:14,498
and he threatened to kill me.

785
00:46:16,267 --> 00:46:19,469
He changed his mind
about me, Skyler,

786
00:46:20,471 --> 00:46:22,806
and so will you.

787

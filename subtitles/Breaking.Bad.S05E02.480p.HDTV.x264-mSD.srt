in your pocket

- Yeah.
- And your jacket was in your locker,

42
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,964
so maybe the cigarette
just fell out of the pocket

that you leave emotion
out of this decision.

166
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,340
I am.

167
00:14:23,374 --> 00:14:25,308
You...

168
00:14:26,843 --> 00:14:28,811
are trouble.

169
00:14:28,845 --> 00:14:33,282
I'm sorry the kid here doesn't
see it, but I sure ash hell do.

170
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:36,618
You are a time bomb...

171
00:14:36,653 --> 00:14:39,755
tick, tick, ticking,

172
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:43,992
and I have no intention
of being around for the boom.

173
00:14:52,902 --> 00:14:55,537
Well, sleep on it.

174
00:14:55,572 --> 00:14:57,572
Maybe you'll reconsider.

175
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,874
In the meantime,

176
00:14:59,908 --> 00:15:02,076
we're pressing on.

177
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,758
Morning.

178
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:25,832
Hey, why aren't you upstairs?

179
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:29,434
- I came to see if you needed any help.
- Yeah, well, I don't.

180
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:31,737
Well, I can see that, man.
It's outstanding.

181
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:33,405
Yeah.
I'm working on it here.

182
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:35,407
Not exactly running
marathons here, you know.

183
00:15:35,441 --> 00:15:37,409
Yeah, well, when did
your couch-shaped ass

184
00:15:37,443 --> 00:15:39,344
ever run any marathons?

185
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:43,181
- I'm proud of you, brother.
- Yeah, yeah. So how many cars we've got?

186
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:44,682
Enough to invade Poland.

187
00:15:44,717 --> 00:15:47,819
Came in their own G5,
just like Oprah has.

188
00:15:47,853 --> 00:15:49,821
- G5, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

189
00:15:49,855 --> 00:15:52,757
Is that one where the--
Where the wings go up like that?

190
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,226
- I think they all do that.
- They all have that?

191
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,629
Anyway, we got two
U.S. attorneys in the house.

192
00:15:57,663 --> 00:16:00,231
Big doings.
Your name keeps coming up.

193
00:16:00,265 --> 00:16:02,265
Yeah? Hey, give me
a hand here, would you?

194
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:04,467
Just-- just a little bit there.
Thanks.

195
00:16:04,502 --> 00:16:08,038
[Herzog]
I hired Peter Schuler in 1992.

196
00:16:08,072 --> 00:16:10,674
Almost single-handedly,

197
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,676
he grew up a little
restaurant division

198
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,778
into an industry leader

199
00:16:14,812 --> 00:16:19,214
and a source
of great personal pride.

200
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:21,951
I am shocked and saddened
by his death

201
00:16:21,985 --> 00:16:28,290
and outraged by the damage his actions have
brought upon my grand-father's company.

202
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:30,426
[Speaks german]

203
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,827
Alleged actions.

204
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:35,964
An innocent man does not
kill himself.

205
00:16:35,998 --> 00:16:38,900
My people and I
are here to help.

206
00:16:38,935 --> 00:16:41,002
Through your investigation
I pledge Madrigal's

207
00:16:41,037 --> 00:16:43,838
full cooperation
and transparency.

208
00:16:44,907 --> 00:16:48,342
I confess I have
my selfish reasons.

209
00:16:48,377 --> 00:16:51,779
I believe Peter Schuler
was a lone anomaly.

210
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:54,114
But if that is not the case,

211
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:55,616
I want to know it,

212
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,651
just as you do.

213
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:02,089
So when you gonna announce it?

214
00:17:02,123 --> 00:17:03,791
I don't know.

215
00:17:03,825 --> 00:17:08,494
- As I'm walking out the door with my
big cardboard box.- You can't do that.

216
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,697
You know damn well we're
gonna throw you a big party.

217
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:13,566
Damn straight.
We're talking a blowout.

218
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:22,007
Outstanding police work, Hank.

219
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,042
If only I'd listened.

220
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,813
But I guess
the damage was done.

221
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:32,450
It's not right,
them putting this on you.

222
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,811
Somebody's gonna go
under the bus.

223
00:17:38,246 --> 00:17:40,258
Ramey's a good man.

224
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,860
He'll do right by you.

225
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:47,131
Besides, this office
practically runs itself.

226
00:17:47,165 --> 00:17:50,234
Bullshit it does.

227
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:51,801
Sir.

228
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:58,342
What's with that APD thing?
The electromagnets?

229
00:17:58,376 --> 00:18:00,343
They're thinking
it's about Fring's laptop.

230
00:18:00,377 --> 00:18:02,478
Turns out a couple of days
before it happened,

231
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:05,381
desk sergeant gets this phone
call from a "postal inspector"--

232
00:18:05,415 --> 00:18:06,882
Quote, unquote--

233
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,817
Wanting to know
where they keep the thing.

234
00:18:08,852 --> 00:18:11,687
And he told them?
Jesus.

235
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:13,689
Anything left of the laptop?

236
00:18:13,723 --> 00:18:16,825
[Scoffs] Do we look that lucky?

237
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,062
You know, I sneaked a peek before
APD took it out of Fring's office.

238
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:22,064
The whole thing was encrypted.

239
00:18:22,098 --> 00:18:24,533
They wouldn't have got
anything anyway, but...

240
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:30,272
So Hector Salamanca
killed Fring.

241
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,729
But who gave
Salamanca the bomb?

242
00:18:34,442 --> 00:18:36,077
Whole lot of questions

243
00:18:36,111 --> 00:18:37,845
and not much
in the way of answers.

244
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,346
Yet.

245
00:18:39,381 --> 00:18:43,484
The APD did find
some of Fring's financials.

246
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:46,139
That just might
lead to something.

247
00:18:50,424 --> 00:18:52,525
I had him out to my house.

248
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,828
Fourth of July.

249
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:57,030
We cooked out in the backyard.

250
00:18:57,065 --> 00:18:58,765
My son shucked the corn.

251
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,534
My daughter cut up potatoes.

252
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:03,236
Fring brought sea bass.

253
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,004
Every time I grill it now,

254
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,540
I make a little foil pouch,
just like he showed me.

255
00:19:08,575 --> 00:19:11,243
That whole night,
we were laughing,

256
00:19:11,277 --> 00:19:15,881
telling stories, drinking wine.

257
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,918
And he's somebody else
completely.

258
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,653
Right in front of me.

259
00:19:24,523 --> 00:19:26,958
Right under my nose.

260
00:19:58,702 --> 00:20:00,670
Hi.
What can I get you?

261
00:20:00,704 --> 00:20:04,006
- Just tea, please. Chamomile.
- Oh, sorry, we don't have chamomile tea.

262
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,843
Then some sort of bergamot,
provided it's not Earl Grey.

263
00:20:06,877 --> 00:20:08,777
I like soy milk
instead of dairy.

264
00:20:08,811 --> 00:20:11,813
We don't have soy milk
or any sort of bergamot.

265
00:20:11,848 --> 00:20:14,449
Wow. You're really running me
through my paces here.

266
00:20:14,484 --> 00:20:15,951
Uh-huh.

267
00:20:15,985 --> 00:20:18,286
Well, English breakfast,
I guess.

268
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,988
We have Lipton's.

269
00:20:20,022 --> 00:20:22,524
That's pretty much all we have.

270
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,527
I would like a cup of
hot water, filtered,

271
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:28,228
if possible,
ad a single slice of lemon.

272
00:20:28,262 --> 00:20:30,230
And I'm assuming
you don't have stevia?

273
00:20:30,264 --> 00:20:33,868
Never mind.
I brought my own.

274
00:20:36,437 --> 00:20:39,039
You coming to me,
or am I coming to you?

275
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:40,707
Face forward.

276
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,809
We'll talk like this.

277
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:46,479
I guess I'm coming to you.

278
00:20:47,615 --> 00:20:49,115
Ohh.

279
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:51,818
Mmm.

280
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:59,591
Take a breath, will you?

281
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:02,628
This place is safe,
no one's gonna see you here.

282
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,031
My God!

283
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:08,867
Duane, this is so--
Thank you.

284
00:21:08,902 --> 00:21:10,969
How did I not see you
sitting back there?

285
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:12,637
So weird.
[Chuckles]

286
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,505
You want anything else, Mike?

287
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,674
No.

288
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,777
I'm good, Fran.
Thanks.

289
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,715
[Sighs]

290
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,451
How about
we lose the sunglasses?

291
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:30,620
I feel like I'm talking
to Jackie Onassis here.

292
00:21:34,158 --> 00:21:36,159
There you go.

293
00:21:37,728 --> 00:21:40,463
Breathe in, breathe out.

294
00:21:40,497 --> 00:21:43,766
Drink your whatever.

295
00:21:53,242 --> 00:21:55,143
Who killed Gus?

296
00:21:55,178 --> 00:21:57,746
Haven't I told you
not to worry about that?

297
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:02,349
Now, what do you want from me,
and why is it so important?

298
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,721
What's this?

299
00:22:06,755 --> 00:22:08,556
A list of 11 names.

300
00:22:08,591 --> 00:22:10,058
Okay.

301
00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:12,426
You know them all.

302
00:22:14,262 --> 00:22:15,729
I do.

303
00:22:15,763 --> 00:22:18,398
Those 11 men-- and I think
you know this, Mike.

304
00:22:18,432 --> 00:22:20,567
Those 11 could sink us,
you and me both.

305
00:22:20,602 --> 00:22:22,502
Where are we going
with this, Lydia?

306
00:22:22,536 --> 00:22:25,105
No specific.
I'm just pointing out facts.

307
00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:27,207
These men-- your men--
yours and Gus's--

308
00:22:27,241 --> 00:22:29,476
these men were on the payroll,
very publicly.

309
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,411
They trace back to Pollos
and the laundry.

310
00:22:31,445 --> 00:22:33,746
They trace back to Madrigal, and they're
gonna get picked up by the police.

311
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,115
And when they do, when they get picked
up and threatened with prosecution,

312
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:38,317
and there's only one way out
for them, they're gonna--

313
00:22:38,351 --> 00:22:40,920
And I'm not saying
all of them. Okay?

314
00:22:40,954 --> 00:22:43,288
All it's gonna take is two
or three, or even one.

315
00:22:43,323 --> 00:22:45,290
But there's always
a weak link somewhere.

316
00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:47,659
But they're gonna talk.
At least one of them's gonna talk about you,

317
00:22:47,693 --> 00:22:50,128
about me, and that's all
it's gonna take.

318
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:53,197
These are the 11 I know of,
but I'd love your input.

319
00:22:53,232 --> 00:22:55,566
I never met your chemist,
for instance.

320
00:22:55,601 --> 00:22:58,302
I'd love your input.

321
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,875
You want me to kill
every man on that list?

322
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:07,645
Wow. That's a leap,

323
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,713
what you just, uh...

324
00:23:09,748 --> 00:23:12,082
No, I didn't say that.

325
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:16,987
But if you think
that'd be wise...

326
00:23:17,989 --> 00:23:19,523
[Sighs]

327
00:23:19,557 --> 00:23:22,158
You're scared, aren't you?

328
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,559
Yeah.

329
00:23:23,593 --> 00:23:25,561
You're very upset,

330
00:23:25,595 --> 00:23:27,864
which I'm gonna factor
into my response here.

331
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:33,569
These are my guys,
and they are solid.

332
00:23:33,603 --> 00:23:35,871
- Understand?
- What about Chow at the warehouse?

333
00:23:35,905 --> 00:23:38,073
Didn't one time you have
to shoot him through the hand?

334
00:23:38,107 --> 00:23:40,142
You think that didn't
stick in his memory?

335
00:23:40,176 --> 00:23:42,077
What about Dennis
at the laundry?

336
00:23:42,111 --> 00:23:43,578
They're sure to pick him up.

337
00:23:43,612 --> 00:23:46,148
They already have.
They picked him up last night.

338
00:23:47,483 --> 00:23:49,617
My guys are solid.

339
00:23:49,652 --> 00:23:52,687
I vetted them with great care,

340
00:23:52,721 --> 00:23:54,855
and Fring made sure
they were well compensated

341
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,124
in the event
of a situation such as this.

342
00:23:57,159 --> 00:23:59,358
They're paid
to stand up to the heat,

343
00:23:59,393 --> 00:24:03,029
keep their mouths shut,
no matter what.

344
00:24:03,064 --> 00:24:05,065
And they will.

345
00:24:06,734 --> 00:24:09,268
Now, I don't know what kind
of movies you've been watching,

346
00:24:09,303 --> 00:24:12,138
but here in the real world,
we don't kill 11 people

347
00:24:12,173 --> 00:24:14,673
as some kind of
prophylactic measure.

348
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:17,676
Look at me

349
00:24:17,711 --> 00:24:20,212
and say you understand.

350
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:23,115
I understand.

351
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:24,950
I get it.

352
00:24:24,984 --> 00:24:27,119
So we're off
that very silly idea?

353
00:24:30,322 --> 00:24:31,823
Good.

354
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,967
Drink your hot water.

355
00:24:53,644 --> 00:24:57,480
- I gotta go.
- Have you had enough?

356
00:24:57,514 --> 00:24:59,216
Yeah. I'm good.

357
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,383
Okay.

358
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:01,751
[Quietly]
Bye-bye.

359
00:25:01,785 --> 00:25:03,219
- Bye.
- Bye.

360
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:04,987
Bye, big brother.
[Chuckles]

361
00:25:05,021 --> 00:25:06,822
Say bye to mom for me.

362
00:25:08,524 --> 00:25:10,893
I will.
Have a good day.

363
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,795
You, too.

364
00:25:14,697 --> 00:25:16,531
[Door opens] [Sighs]

365
00:25:17,634 --> 00:25:19,167
[Door closes]

366
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:28,910
[Quietly] - Skyler.
- Mmm...

367
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,245
Hey.

368
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:33,414
The car wash opens
in 15 minutes.

369
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,316
Mariano can open for me today.

370
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:43,723
Hey, how about you get up, huh?

371
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,628
Come on.

372
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,798
A shower will feel good.

373
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,381
Hey, Chow.

374
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:14,452
How you holding up?

375
00:26:14,486 --> 00:26:16,554
Okay.

376
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:19,024
You know,
they-- they--

377
00:26:19,058 --> 00:26:20,992
They talked to me.

378
00:26:21,027 --> 00:26:23,660
You can't smoke in here, Chow.

379
00:26:44,148 --> 00:26:46,149
[Elevator bell dings] [Hank]
Thanks for coming down.

380
00:26:46,183 --> 00:26:49,152
Have a seat,
Mr. Ehrmantraut.

381
00:26:49,186 --> 00:26:52,021
Am I, is that right?

382
00:26:52,056 --> 00:26:54,223
Close enough.

383
00:26:54,257 --> 00:26:57,625
So, once more, you're waiving your
right to have an attorney present?

384
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,127
Correct.

385
00:26:59,162 --> 00:27:01,230
Could you state that
to the camera, please?

386
00:27:01,264 --> 00:27:04,299
I'm waiving my right
to have an attorney present.

387
00:27:04,334 --> 00:27:07,802
Uh, okay, then.
We just have a few questions.

388
00:27:07,837 --> 00:27:11,239
You're currently employed
by the Pollos Hermanos chain.

389
00:27:11,273 --> 00:27:12,907
- Is that correct?
- Yes, I am.

390
00:27:12,941 --> 00:27:15,042
- And what do you do there?
- Corporate security.

391
00:27:15,077 --> 00:27:17,311
- Corporate security?
- Yeah.

392
00:27:17,346 --> 00:27:21,048
What's that?
Like, uh, guarding the special sauce?

393
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:23,751
I conduct employee
background checks,

394
00:27:23,785 --> 00:27:26,219
I oversee loss prevention.

395
00:27:26,254 --> 00:27:29,890
At a fast-food restaurant,
that's a full-time job?

396
00:27:29,924 --> 00:27:33,226
We have 14 locations.
So, yes, it's a full-time job.

397
00:27:33,261 --> 00:27:34,895
Yeah, well...
[Chuckles]

398
00:27:34,929 --> 00:27:37,630
If I were you, I'd start
sending out those resumes.

399
00:27:37,664 --> 00:27:40,533
It says here you're
a private investigator?

400
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:42,167
Where you licensed?

401
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,936
New Mexico, Arizona, Utah.

402
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,637
Every state where we operate.

403
00:27:45,671 --> 00:27:47,239
Colorado?

404
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:48,908
You have some restaurants
there, right?

405
00:27:48,942 --> 00:27:50,776
Colorado doesn't
require licensure.

406
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,644
You licensed
to carry a firearm?

407
00:27:52,678 --> 00:27:54,579
Concealed carry?
Yes, I am.

408
00:27:54,614 --> 00:27:56,115
Which states?

409
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:58,983
It'd be quicker to mention
the states in which I'm not.

410
00:27:59,018 --> 00:28:00,985
And if we pulled your CCP's,

411
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,486
everything would be in order?

412
00:28:02,521 --> 00:28:04,956
I'm guessing you've already
done that, so you tell me.

413
00:28:07,893 --> 00:28:10,228
You strike me as a former cop.

414
00:28:10,262 --> 00:28:11,762
Am I right?

415
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:15,193
Where at?

416
00:28:17,835 --> 00:28:19,336
Philadelphia.

417
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,405
Philly.
[Chuckles]

418
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:23,407
The city of brotherly love.

419
00:28:23,441 --> 00:28:27,177
It turns out we, uh--
We know some folks there,

420
00:28:27,211 --> 00:28:30,246
and they told us that your
tenure as a police officer

421
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,183
ended somewhat,
uh, dramatically?

422
00:28:34,217 --> 00:28:36,118
You wanna talk about that?

423
00:28:36,153 --> 00:28:37,686
Not particularly.

424
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,122
Yeah, me neither.

425
00:28:41,724 --> 00:28:43,792
See, I'm more interested
in why Gus Fring

426
00:28:43,827 --> 00:28:45,928
decided to put a guy like you

427
00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:48,163
in charge of
his corporate security.

428
00:28:48,197 --> 00:28:52,600
I mean,
given your... history

429
00:28:52,634 --> 00:28:56,004
doing background checks
on pimple-faced fry cooks.

430
00:28:56,005 --> 00:28:57,005
Seems like over...

431
00:28:57,974 --> 00:29:00,308
What else you do for Fring?

432
00:29:00,343 --> 00:29:02,977
He must've needed help
running that drug empire

433
00:29:03,011 --> 00:29:04,811
of his, no?

434
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:07,481
Drug empire?

435
00:29:07,515 --> 00:29:12,186
First I'm hearing about that.
I don't know anything about that.

436
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,989
Hey, man, we have a guy that could
put you in that underground lab,

437
00:29:15,023 --> 00:29:16,556
and he'll testify to it.

438
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:19,725
So from here on out,
this can go hard or easy,

439
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,295
so what's it gonna be?

440
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,539
Forget your handcuffs?

441
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:35,907
I'm confused.

442
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,343
Am I under arrest here,
or am I not?

443
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:47,419
You wanna state that
for the camera?

444
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:55,826
You are not under arrest,
currently.

445
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,362
Agents, do you have
any more questions for me?

446
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:01,432
Because you've got me
very stirred up

447
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,767
with all these false accusations.

448
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:06,237
If I'm not under arrest,
I'd prefer to leave.

449
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,973
Uh-uh.

450
00:30:13,277 --> 00:30:16,780
And I suppose we could talk
about the two million dollars

451
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:19,550
in your granddaughter's name.

452
00:30:22,686 --> 00:30:24,654
Yeah. It seems, uh,

453
00:30:24,688 --> 00:30:27,189
Fring had all these
secret offshore accounts

454
00:30:27,223 --> 00:30:28,858
that he would
deposit money into--

455
00:30:28,892 --> 00:30:30,526
Like, uh, well,
an even dozen of them--

456
00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:31,994
And they're all in the names

457
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:33,529
of certain people
on his payroll.

458
00:30:33,564 --> 00:30:36,699
There was the, uh--
The manager of the laundry,

459
00:30:36,733 --> 00:30:40,769
um, a couple guys from
the Pollos distribution center.

460
00:30:40,803 --> 00:30:44,639
There was the owner of a chemical
warehouse, a bunch of others.

461
00:30:44,674 --> 00:30:48,409
You know, guys that must've been
getting paid off the books.

462
00:30:48,444 --> 00:30:54,182
Anyway, one of the names
was Kaylee Ehrmantraut.

463
00:30:54,216 --> 00:30:57,785
Ten years old

464
00:30:57,819 --> 00:31:00,387
and just cute as a button.

465
00:31:00,421 --> 00:31:02,556
Yeah.
Two million and change

466
00:31:02,591 --> 00:31:04,692
we found on deposit for her.

467
00:31:04,726 --> 00:31:06,560
Way more than anybody else.

468
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:08,562
Now, my partner here,

469
00:31:08,597 --> 00:31:10,897
he took one look at that
and said, "Shit, man.

470
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:14,233
This fifth-grade girl is the muscle
behind Fring's entire operation."

471
00:31:14,267 --> 00:31:16,803
I said, "Whoa, whoa.
Hey, partner, slow down there.

472
00:31:16,837 --> 00:31:18,838
Maybe it was actually

473
00:31:18,872 --> 00:31:21,808
her dear old granddaddy."

474
00:31:21,842 --> 00:31:24,143
Impressive, no?

475
00:31:24,177 --> 00:31:25,878
But...
[Clicks tongue]

476
00:31:25,913 --> 00:31:27,579
Level of insight?

477
00:31:28,848 --> 00:31:30,983
He's not impressed, Gomie.

478
00:31:31,017 --> 00:31:34,720
Perhaps he's picturing
all that money going bye-bye.

479
00:31:34,754 --> 00:31:36,722
Yeah, well, I mean,

480
00:31:36,756 --> 00:31:40,826
the government's gonna take
every last dollar, unless...

481
00:31:42,828 --> 00:31:44,795
Well, here's the thing, Mike--
or Michael?

482
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,064
- Mr. Ehrmantraut.
- Here's the thing, Mike.

483
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:48,899
Lucky for you,
you didn't touch that money.

484
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:52,069
I cannot say the same
for the other 11 on the list.

485
00:31:52,104 --> 00:31:54,304
One of your guys
is gonna roll on you,

486
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:56,807
and then we'll definitely
remember the handcuffs.

487
00:31:56,842 --> 00:31:58,842
Now, before that day comes,

488
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:01,778
you can do yourself a solid.

489
00:32:01,812 --> 00:32:04,748
You can tell us what you know,

490
00:32:04,782 --> 00:32:08,417
you can tell us
who's still out there,

491
00:32:08,452 --> 00:32:11,354
and if we like your story,

492
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,356
good things can happen.

493
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,691
Kaylee might be able
to keep some of that money.

494
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,093
Maybe.

495
00:32:18,128 --> 00:32:20,295
So what do you say?

496
00:32:24,834 --> 00:32:27,502
I don't know anything
about any money.

497
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,472
I don't know
what you're talking about.

498
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,134
First order of business

499
00:32:44,168 --> 00:32:46,303
is to find a new place to cook.

500
00:32:46,337 --> 00:32:49,671
Before anyone says it,
no more RV's.

501
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:52,674
I don't know. The crystal
ship did pretty good for us.

502
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:54,477
The "crystal ship"?

503
00:32:54,511 --> 00:33:00,116
- Yeah. That's what I called it. - Well,
I'll admit it held us on as a starter lab,

504
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,518
but it was too dark, too small,

505
00:33:02,552 --> 00:33:04,520
not to mention
it could've broken down

506
00:33:04,554 --> 00:33:06,021
at any moment.

507
00:33:06,055 --> 00:33:09,224
Saul, find us someplace
safe from prying eyes.

508
00:33:09,258 --> 00:33:11,692
Security against detection
is paramount.

509
00:33:11,727 --> 00:33:13,361
But I don't
wanna drive too far.

510
00:33:13,396 --> 00:33:16,464
No more 50-mile treks
to some Indian reservation.

511
00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:17,965
In town is trickier.

512
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,468
I mean, you got a lot more
of your prying eyes.

513
00:33:20,503 --> 00:33:24,799
If Gus can manage it,
then so can we.

514
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:30,477
Precursor.
Where are we with that?

515
00:33:31,913 --> 00:33:33,847
Uh, we're good on everything

516
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:37,483
except, uh, methylamine.

517
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:39,185
No surprise.

518
00:33:39,219 --> 00:33:41,187
It's just dry as hell out there.

519
00:33:41,221 --> 00:33:43,856
What if we switched back
to a pseudo cook?

520
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,691
Absolutely out of the question.

521
00:33:45,725 --> 00:33:48,861
Jesse, there is methylamine out there.
I know it.

522
00:33:48,895 --> 00:33:50,530
Yeah, but what if there's not?

523
00:33:50,564 --> 00:33:54,199
Because there isn't.
I mean, really.

524
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:56,068
There is.

525
00:33:56,102 --> 00:33:58,870
Have faith.

526
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:00,905
Can I--
Can I offer a thought?

527
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,240
Uh...

528
00:34:03,276 --> 00:34:05,410
Say a guy wins the lottery.

529
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:07,345
Ten million bucks.

530
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,481
The very next day,
what's the one thing he does not do?

531
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:13,150
He does not go buy another
lottery ticket, right?

532
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:17,188
He counts his lucky stars, and
he sails off into the sunset,

533
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:20,324
which, seems to me,
and all due respect,

534
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:23,694
some advice you two might take.

535
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,063
What lottery did I win exactly?

536
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:28,731
Hey, you're alive.

537
00:34:28,765 --> 00:34:31,701
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
that's the Irish sweepstakes.

538
00:34:31,735 --> 00:34:33,970
I'm alive, and I'm broke.

539
00:34:34,004 --> 00:34:35,972
Counting the money
that I owe Jesse,

540
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:37,773
I'm about 40 grand in the hole.

541
00:34:37,808 --> 00:34:39,609
Does that seem like
an acceptable

542
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:41,677
stopping point to you?

543
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:46,548
There is gold in the streets,

544
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:51,954
just waiting for someone to come and
scoop it up. But, me? I should quit now.

545
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:54,423
Jesse, too, I suppose, huh?

546
00:34:54,457 --> 00:34:55,992
Wow.

547
00:34:56,026 --> 00:34:59,160
I got you this time, kid.

548
00:34:59,194 --> 00:35:01,830
And how come you get two,
and I only get one?

549
00:35:01,864 --> 00:35:04,633
Hmm?

550
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:06,300
Oh, no, you don't.

551
00:35:06,335 --> 00:35:08,670
That one's mine!

552
00:35:08,704 --> 00:35:10,005
[Mutters]

553
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:12,974
No. Aaahhh!

554
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:15,342
[Phone buzzing] [Mutters]

555
00:35:19,114 --> 00:35:20,948
Oh.

556
00:35:20,982 --> 00:35:22,750
[Buzzing continues]

557
00:35:22,784 --> 00:35:24,885
I give up, baby.

558
00:35:26,688 --> 00:35:28,689
You're too good.

559
00:35:28,723 --> 00:35:29,722
[Beeps]

560
00:35:29,757 --> 00:35:34,160
- Yeah?
It's me, you got a minute?

561
00:35:34,194 --> 00:35:36,796
Yeah. A minute.
What's up, Chow?

562
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:40,099
The DEA,
they call me to come back.

563
00:35:40,134 --> 00:35:43,169
- Say they want to talk more.
- I'm sure they do.

564
00:35:43,203 --> 00:35:45,104
[Toy whirring]
Did you call your lawyer?

565
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:48,173
Yeah, but, Mike,
the DEA take all my money.

566
00:35:48,207 --> 00:35:49,507
I need it.

567
00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:51,509
I need my money.

568
00:35:51,544 --> 00:35:53,511
You understand.

569
00:35:53,546 --> 00:35:56,114
What do you want me
to do about it?

570
00:35:56,149 --> 00:35:57,949
I don't know.

571
00:35:57,984 --> 00:36:00,686
I don't know.
We gotta talk.

572
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,519
Not on the phone.

573
00:36:02,554 --> 00:36:04,655
Can you come to my house?

574
00:36:08,526 --> 00:36:09,994
All right.

575
00:36:10,028 --> 00:36:11,996
Give me two hours.

576
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,197
[Beeps]

577

[Whirring, thudding continue]

579
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:40,879
[Mike] Chris.

580
00:37:43,448 --> 00:37:45,917
I'd like you to drop your gun
where you stand,

581
00:37:45,951 --> 00:37:49,287
and then turn around
very slowly.

582

[Gun clatters]

[Sighs]

584
00:38:04,502 --> 00:38:07,505
Come on over
and sit next to Chow.

585
00:38:25,155 --> 00:38:27,222
[Exhales forcefully]

586
00:38:29,425 --> 00:38:32,093
How much was she gonna pay you?

587
00:38:34,297 --> 00:38:36,464
Ten thousand a name.

588
00:38:38,434 --> 00:38:41,502
How far did you get
down the list?

589
00:38:41,537 --> 00:38:43,070
Just Chow.

590
00:38:43,104 --> 00:38:45,105
I figured I'd start with you.

591
00:38:46,107 --> 00:38:48,442
For you,
she was gonna pay 30,000.

592
00:38:50,883 --> 00:38:52,143
I'm very sorry about this, Mike.

593
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,381
But I needed the money.

594
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,417
Those feds,
they took it all, man.

Are you ready?

Listen, Mike...

[Woman] Kira, come and
have some cookies.

It's a cookie!

It's a cookie, yes!

Hey, yourself.

here, Delores?

646
00:41:28,174 --> 00:41:31,108
I won't have to
unless you scream.

647
00:41:31,142 --> 00:41:33,476
You know why I'm here?

648
00:41:36,247 --> 00:41:38,515
What are you waiting for?

649
00:41:38,549 --> 00:41:40,650
The nanny to leave.

650
00:41:41,686 --> 00:41:43,653
If you have anything
to say to me,

651
00:41:43,688 --> 00:41:45,855
now's the time.

652
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:50,827
[Scoffs]

653
00:41:52,896 --> 00:41:55,698
Two good men died
because of you.

654
00:41:58,468 --> 00:42:00,502
Don't shoot me in the face.

655
00:42:00,537 --> 00:42:01,837
Please.

656
00:42:01,871 --> 00:42:03,939
I don't want my daughter
seeing me like that.

657
00:42:03,973 --> 00:42:06,474
- Your daughter won't see you.
- Yes, she will. She'll find me.

658
00:42:06,508 --> 00:42:08,476
She never once sleeps
through the night.

659
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,312
Nobody's gonna find you, Lydia.

660
00:42:11,347 --> 00:42:13,315
Wait. What?

661
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:15,083
No.

662
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:16,884
No. No.

663
00:42:16,918 --> 00:42:19,286
No! Sh-she
has to find me.

664
00:42:19,321 --> 00:42:21,688
- Lower your voice.
[Whispering] - She has to find me.

665
00:42:21,723 --> 00:42:23,457
She has to find me.
I-- I--

666
00:42:23,491 --> 00:42:25,692
You want your
five-year-old daughter

667
00:42:25,727 --> 00:42:27,694
stumbling across
your dead body?

668
00:42:27,729 --> 00:42:30,797
I can't just disappear.
She has to know I didn't leave her.

669
00:42:30,832 --> 00:42:33,032
- She has to know that!
- Keep your voice down.

670
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:34,968
I don't care what you do.

671
00:42:35,002 --> 00:42:36,936
I'll scream and
I'll keep screaming.

672
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,604
My daughter's not thinking
I abandoned her!

673
00:42:38,638 --> 00:42:41,875
Shut up and calm down.

674
00:42:41,909 --> 00:42:43,776
I don't care.
You have to promise.

675
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,845
You have to promise me...
[Door closes]

676
00:42:54,287 --> 00:42:57,689
Promise I don't disappear.

677
00:43:22,746 --> 00:43:25,581
Can you still get
your hands on methylamine?

678
00:43:29,586 --> 00:43:31,554
Methylamine, Lydia.

679
00:43:31,588 --> 00:43:33,957
Can you still get it?

680
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:37,126
Maybe.

681
00:43:38,929 --> 00:43:40,495
Why?

682
00:43:49,806 --> 00:43:51,140
[Beeps]

683
00:43:52,575 --> 00:43:54,375
[Phone buzzing]

684
00:43:55,377 --> 00:43:56,610
Aww...

685
00:43:56,645 --> 00:43:57,979
[Buzzing continues]

686
00:44:04,253 --> 00:44:05,619
Yes?

687
00:44:05,654 --> 00:44:09,089
[Mike] You still plan
to move forward?

688
00:44:09,123 --> 00:44:10,790
Yes, we do.

689
00:44:11,826 --> 00:44:15,462
I've reconsidered.
I'm in.

690
00:44:17,598 --> 00:44:19,099
Good.

691
00:44:34,114 --> 00:44:36,382
[Grunting]

692
00:44:37,851 --> 00:44:41,319
Well, you missed a good meal.

693
00:44:41,354 --> 00:44:43,989
The lasagna came out very well,

694
00:44:44,023 --> 00:44:46,124
if I do say so myself.
[Shoe thuds]

695
00:44:48,794 --> 00:44:52,230
I wrapped some up for you
if you'd like some later.

696
00:44:52,264 --> 00:44:54,966
[Shoe thuds] [Grunts]

697
00:44:59,837 --> 00:45:02,172
[Exhales forcefully]

698
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:11,515
You know, it gets easier.

699
00:45:11,549 --> 00:45:13,949
I promise you that it does.

700
00:45:17,021 --> 00:45:19,188
What you're feeling
right now...

701
00:45:20,457 --> 00:45:23,926
About, uh, Ted...

702
00:45:25,529 --> 00:45:27,296
Everything...

703
00:45:30,366 --> 00:45:32,300
It'll pass.

704
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,021
[Sighs]

705
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,651
When we do...

706
00:46:27,687 --> 00:46:30,521
what we do for good reasons...

707
00:46:35,995 --> 00:46:38,529
then we've got
nothing to worry about.

708
00:46:44,102 --> 00:46:46,403
And there's no better reason...

709
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:50,074
than family.

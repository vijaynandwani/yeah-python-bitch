1
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,160
Why?

2
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:39,623
Why is this still under discussion?

3
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,879
I don't like him.

4
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,549
I don't care who he knows.

5
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:53,303
We're supposed to trust
him with our products.

6
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,266
Big man.

7
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,101
Big Generalissimo!

8
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,229
Big fry cook is more like it.

9
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,940
The". Chicken Man."

10
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,192
You will do what you want.

11
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,528
But you have my vote.

12
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,663
Never trust a South American.

13
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,332
Dirty, dirty people.

14
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,549
He broke my toy! He broke my toy!

15
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,844
He was just having fun.

16
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,014
You'll get over it.

17
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,142
No! I hate him! I wish he was dead!

18
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,949
Marco.

19
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,789
Grab your old uncle a beer,
would you?

20
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:08,754
No, no. A cold one.

21
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,431
This is what you wanted.

22
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,309
Your brother dead. Right?

23
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,607
You're going to have to
try harder than that...

24
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,360
...if you want to save him.

25
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:36,657
How much longer do you think
he has down there?

26
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:41,036
One minute? Maybe more? Maybe less?

27
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:00,055
Family is all.

28
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,572
Hey, you got nothing on me, yo.

29
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,909
All right, you can call my lawyer,
Saul Goodman.

30
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,827
Talk to my lawyer, all right?

31
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,414
You hear me? I got nothing to say.
I told you, you can call my...

32
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,751
Christ!

33
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:57,506
You got my cell phone number,
my wife's name! How did you do it?

34
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,342
Talk! Who you working with?!

35
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,373
Yes, sir.

36
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,844
If you're ready to talk...

37
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,888
...they wanna get a statement.

38
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,183
Your side of what happened here.

39
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,521
Or we can hold them off
till another time.

40
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:42,444
Maybe you wanna talk to a lawyer.

41
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,164
There it is.

42
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,876
Yo, Adrian.

43
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,337
Rocky called,
he wants his face back.

44
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,799
Come on, I gotta cheer you up.

45
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,927
You see that?
That's your get-out-of-jail-free card.

46
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,054
You understand
get-out-of-jail-free card?

47
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:12,307
I mean, just blink once
if you're following.

48
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:16,311
The DEA's worst nightmare
is that face out in public.

49
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,481
They'll have to steer a wide berth
of young Master Pinkman...

50
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,151
...for fear of the PR poop storm
that will rain down on them...

51
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,155
...if this story ever gets out.
I mean, this beating?

52
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,449
Best thing for you.

53
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:30,993
You're home free.

54
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,912
Good, right?

55
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:35,998
Right.

56
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,853
Oh, my God.

57
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:03,483
You're now the cute one of the group.
Paul, meet Ringo. Ringo, Paul.

58
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,906
This is... I...

59
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:15,370
Jesse, I'm... I am so sorry for this.
This should not have happened.

60
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,124
But it did.

61
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,835
No thanks to you.

62
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,883
But the plan did work.

63
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:32,387
We would've been locked up right now
if we didn't lure him away. But this...

64
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,182
This... I just...

65
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:36,975
I never saw this coming.

66
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,815
So...

67
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,485
What...?

68
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:48,737
What happens now?

69
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,906
What happens now?

70
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:55,160
I'll tell you what happens now.

71
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:59,748
Your scumbag brother-in-law
is finished.

72
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,750
Done.

73
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,418
You understand?

74
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:07,798
I will own him when this is over.

75
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,093
Every cent he... earns...

76
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:14,721
...every cent his wife... earns...

77
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,266
...is mine.

78
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,685
Anyplace he goes...

79
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,895
...anywhere he turns...

80
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:24,106
...I'm gonna be there...

81
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,900
...grabbing my share.

82
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:32,030
He'll be scrubbing toilets in Tijuana
for pennies...

83
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,491
...and I'll be standing over him...

84
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,910
...to get my cut.

85
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,454
He'll see me when he wakes up...

86
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:44,543
...and when he crawls to sleep
in whatever rat hole is left for him...

87
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,255
...after I shred his house down.

88
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:53,177
I will haunt his crusty ass...

89
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,095
...forever...

90
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,431
...until the day...

91
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:00,934
...he sticks a gun up his mouth...

92
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:03,228
...and pulls the trigger...

93
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,565
...just to get me out of his head.

94
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:13,488
That's what happens next.

95
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,290
My advice:

96
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,752
That's probably
not a good strategy.

97
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,881
They're scared of you right now.
They want nothing to do with you.

98
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,883
But if you hit them...

99
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,802
...they're forced to hit back hard.

100
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:39,890
I mean, they will turn over every rock
hither, thither and yon...

101
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:43,810
...until someone spills the beans on you
and anyone associated with you...

102
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,562
...present company included.

103
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:48,774
Yes, I think what Saul is saying
makes a lot of sense.

104
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:53,445
Jesse, move on with your life.

105
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,113
Leave it behind, all of it.

106
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,533
Nothing changes...

107
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,160
...once I walk out of here.

108
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:05,249
I get myself a new RV
and go start cooking again.

109
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:09,837
How exactly do you think...

110
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:13,423
...you're going to get away with that?
They will catch you.

111
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,467
- So what?
- What?

112
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,636
I have a get-out-of-jail-free card.

113
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:22,724
Hey, I may have overstated
the power of your face.

114
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,394
Not this.

115
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:28,814
If the cops catch me...

116
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,068
...I give them
what they want the most.

117
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,074
You.

118
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,123
They nab me...

119
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,542
...I make a deal...

120
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,380
...to give up the great Heisenberg...

121
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:57,801
...and his million-dollar drug ring.

122
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,308
You're my free pass...

123
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,186
...bitch.

124
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,317
<i>You're so sure.</i>

125
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:17,237
Look, if he didn't give up my name
while Hank was beating him...

126
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:18,989
...he's never going to talk.

127
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,491
What do you think that was, a bluff?

128
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,162
He wants your brother-in-law.
And there's gonna be lawyers...

129
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,623
...creaming their Underoos
for a case like that.

130
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:31,335
I'd take it myself if it wouldn't
cause so much collateral damage.

131
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,045
And him cooking again?

132
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:37,382
Hey, when, not if, he gets caught,
and he's facing 20 years...

133
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:42,012
...what'll he do then? Believe me,
there's no honour among thieves.

134
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,265
Except for us, of course.

135
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:47,768
No, he'll...

136
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,978
He'll come around.

137
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:52,606
And if he doesn't...

138
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,275
...there may come a time
to talk options.

139
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,027
Options?

140
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:14,461
I'm convinced
Mr. Pinkman was involved...

141
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,965
...in the manufacture and distribution
of phenyl-2 methamphetamine...

142
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,300
...specifically what we call
the blue meth.

143
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,386
I tracked him to a scrap yard...

144
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,055
...where he stored
an early-'80s camper...

145
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:26,932
...an RV.

146
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,893
While waiting for a warrant
to search this vehicle...

147
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:32,938
...which I believe to be
a rolling meth lab...

148
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,566
...I received a telephone call...

149
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:40,863
...telling me my wife Marie
had been injured in an accident.

150
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:42,322
Upon hearing the news...

151
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:46,743
...I left Mr. Pinkman
and his vehicle to tend to my wife.

152
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:51,081
Arriving at the hospital, I learned
the... emergency call was a hoax.

153
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,668
My wife, fortunately, was unharmed.

154
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:01,675
So I immediately went back to
the salvage yard, but the RV was gone.

155
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:04,136
Most likely destroyed on site.

156
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,556
And it was at this point you drove
to the home of Jesse Pinkman?

157
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:21,278
I think we're done here.

158
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,031
Agent Schrader needs to get home...

159
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:25,240
...get some rest.

160
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:30,245
That's fine. But just to confirm,
you're taking the Fifth here?

161
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:31,914
Yeah, that's correct.

162
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,916
Okay. Well...

163
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,585
...we just wanna give you all
a heads up.

164
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,464
Mr. Pinkman is pressing charges
in this matter.

165
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:44,843
He's given a detailed version
of events as he sees them.

166
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,345
The word of a meth head.

167
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,180
We know all about his history.

168
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,850
We're well aware,
but toxicology on Pinkman...

169
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,395
His blood is clean, he's not using.

170
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:58,690
The kid is even refusing his
doctor-ordered pain meds...

171
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,609
...far as we can tell.

172
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,988
So...

173
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,617
...where do we go from here?

174
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,411
A couple of gentlemen
from OPR will come down...

175
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,455
...probably tomorrow morning.

176
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:15,791
Janice will give us an exact time.

177
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:20,963
And you men will be continuing
your investigation, so...

178
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:25,133
- Thanks for your time.
- Right. We just...

179
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,552
We need one more thing.

180
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:31,807
A photo of Agent Schrader's hands.
For the record.

181
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,560
Yes, of course.

182
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,020
Bandage off, if you would.

183
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:44,778
On the table is fine.

184
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:48,031
Flat on the table. That's fine.

185
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:30,259
It's all gonna work out.

186
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:34,137
You've been too good to them
for too many years.

187
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:39,685
I hope it goes without saying we're not
talking to anybody about this, okay?

188
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,521
Okay.

189
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,191
Marie...

190
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,110
...who?

191
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:23,687
Hi.

192
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,148
Do you have a minute?

193
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,358
Sure.

194
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:45,209
I guess crime does pay.

195
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:52,883
I don't suppose you just came by
to insult me.

196
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,763
No. We need to talk.

197
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,432
You heard about Hank?

198
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:04,770
About what happened
with this Jesse Pinkman?

199
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:07,105
Yes, I know.

200
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,608
Whatever Hank was investigating...

201
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:13,654
...him trying to find an RV...

202
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,614
...is there any danger...

203
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,158
...that could lead back to you?

204
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:20,536
No.

205
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:22,412
Why would it?

206
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,085
Is this why you're here?

207
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,588
I'm here to talk about Hank.

208
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:38,762
You know what's gonna happen to him
if this Pinkman presses charges?

209
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,600
Hank could lose... everything.

210
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,647
I thought maybe...

211
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,985
...there's a way you could help him.

212
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:55,070
How?

213
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:58,156
Contact Pinkman.

214
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:00,367
Get him to drop the charges.

215
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:04,788
I don't know what kind of relationship
you picture me having with this person.

216
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:09,459
- I'm not asking.
- He was... He's... He's not my friend.

217
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,087
- It's not as if we were... even close.
- I'm...

218
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:14,339
I'm not asking.

219
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:17,092
But there must be something
you could say.

220
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:20,304
Isn't it even worth a try?

221
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,515
Hank is your family.

222
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,312
Not currently.

223
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,563
What?

224
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,566
I said, not currently.

225
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:37,112
I'm late. I have to go.

226
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:10,687
Hello.

227
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:13,774
I was starting to get worried.

228
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,194
Car trouble.

229
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,113
Oh, that's a bummer.

230
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,951
You should call me next time.
I'll pick you up.

231
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:30,832
No sandals today?

232
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,252
I just thought...

233
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,880
A bit more professional.

234
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:40,509
Well, everything is on track.

235
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:45,180
We got our distillate.
Just waiting to...

236
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:47,307
Let's get our trays ready.

237
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:49,893
- Clean, no moisture.
- Done.

238
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:55,274
Is our...?

239
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:57,651
Our solvent filtered?

240
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:59,903
I thought you might ask that.

241
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:01,113
Done.

242
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:05,284
That's good.

243
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:06,743
That's good.

244
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:10,163
Hand in glove,
that's what we strive for.

245
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:16,461
You know, this might be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

246
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,454
So you the gentlemen?

247
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:57,794
Lucky you boys caught me,
I got a load to pick up in Memphis.

248
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:02,299
I can hammer it out in about 15,
but there's this girl, Lolly. Maybe Fran.

249
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:04,801
She's got this fetish,
she likes to get peed on.

250
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,305
I was hoping to see her tonight
but she wants to sleep before 10...

251
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:12,976
...so I wanna wrap it up here ASAP
because traffic can be a wild card.

252
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:18,148
Thing is, women who like to get peed on
tend to be from the warmer climates.

253
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:21,318
You'd think the ones in colder zones
would be more inclined.

254
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:23,904
Maybe it's a shock
if the body's not acclimated...

255
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:27,407
...but, you know, I leave that
for smarter minds than me.

256
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:30,786
Science is a mystery.

257
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:33,956
Well, take a gander.
Prices are negotiable.

258
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:38,168
Buying in bulk gets you a discount.
I'm running a special on these honeys.

259
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:43,715
JHPs. Hollow-point bullets,
known as Black Death. Check it out.

260
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:45,717
Like that?
So sweet, you wanna lick it.

261
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:48,220
Nickel-plated brass casing,
Lubalox coat.

262
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:51,682
Sucker has six razor claws
that expand upon impact:

263
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,351
Shred your mama's head
like a cabbage.

264
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:58,063
Keep it. On the house.
But I been windjamming enough.

265
00:23:58,272 --> 00:24:01,441
Tell me what you're looking for,
what it is you need.

266
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:02,901
Vests.

267
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,988
Vests? Hell, yeah, we got vests.

268
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:07,865
Right here.

269
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,205
Sleek, comfortable, thermally bonded,
non-interwoven Kevlar fibre.

270
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:19,209
Stop a bullet like a soft wang against
a Quaker girl. Ain't getting through.

271
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:23,088
And lightweight? So lightweight,
you'll forget you're wearing it.

272
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:26,091
They work?

273
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,927
Sure as shit, they do.

274
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:31,180
I don't leave home without it.

275
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:40,939
What the hell?

276
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:45,611
You broke my freaking rib,
you maniac son of a bitch.

277
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:18,644
You're welcome!

278
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:37,913
Gale.

279
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:40,874
What temperature did you set here?

280
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:42,584
Here?

281
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,504
Station five, 75 C.

282
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:50,467
I said 85.

283
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:51,802
Eight-five.

284
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:58,517
I wrote it down. You said 75.

285
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,853
- I wrote it.
- Well, you wrote it wrong.

286
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:02,646
That's not what I said.

287
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:04,106
I said 85.

288
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:07,526
It's always been 85.

289
00:26:07,943 --> 00:26:11,071
Not 75. Not 95.

290
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,447
Eighty-five.

291
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:16,285
This is chemistry. Degrees matter.

292
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,206
I'm sorry.

293
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:23,333
I'm very sorry.

294
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:24,626
Great.

295
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:26,336
You're sorry, meanwhile...

296
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:30,465
...you've just brewed 50 gallons
of useless sludge. Congratulations.

297
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:33,010
Just dump it. Dump it all.

298
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:35,137
This batch is ruined.

299
00:27:08,212 --> 00:27:10,172
You look nice.

300
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,259
I look like a TV weatherman.

301
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,096
You want a coffee?

302
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:22,476
No.

303
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:28,148
I squeezed some orange juice.
You want a glass of orange juice?

304
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:30,651
I'm all right.

305
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:40,077
What are you gonna tell them?

306
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:46,667
Here's what you'll tell them.

307
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,711
He attacked you.

308
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:54,466
- He attacked me?
- He swung at you with something.

309
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:57,636
- Swung at me?
- He attacked you with a pipe.

310
00:27:57,845 --> 00:27:59,429
A pipe.

311
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:05,394
It happened fast. He resisted arrest
and muscle memory kicked in...

312
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,855
...and you had to disarm him.

313
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:09,773
Muscle memory.

314
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:15,070
Happens all the time. Years of training,
your body acted faster than your brain.

315
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,989
You had no choice but to hit him.

316
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:20,284
- You had to fight back.
- Marie, Marie, Marie.

317
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:22,911
No.

318
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:26,039
I'm not gonna go in there and lie.

319
00:28:26,248 --> 00:28:30,669
It's some lowlife degenerate
versus you...

320
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:34,256
...doing the job you're supposed to.

321
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:38,135
Why should you be the one
who pays...

322
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:40,137
...for doing the right thing?

323
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:43,015
Oh, baby, it wasn't the right thing.

324
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:46,351
It's not what the job is.

325
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:49,730
I'm supposed to be better than that.

326
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:53,984
And you made one mistake.

327
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:58,363
No, it wasn't one mistake. I've been...

328
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:02,743
I've been...

329
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,498
...unravelling, you know?

330
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:14,796
I don't sleep at night anymore.

331
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,175
I freeze.

332
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:20,302
I freeze up.

333
00:29:22,054 --> 00:29:25,557
My chest gets all tight.
I can't breathe.

334
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:28,310
Just...

335
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:31,104
I panic.

336
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:36,944
Ever since that Salamanca thing.

337
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:39,154
I mean, Tuco Salamanca.

338
00:29:39,363 --> 00:29:43,283
If ever a scumbag deserved a bullet
between the... eyes...

339
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,249
It changed me.

340
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:57,464
And I can't seem to control it.

341
00:30:01,093 --> 00:30:03,136
I tried to fight it.

342
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:07,349
But then...

343
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:09,309
...El Paso.

344
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:13,105
And it's just gotten worse.

345
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:18,777
What I did to Pinkman...

346
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:24,950
...that's not who I'm supposed to be.
That's not me.

347
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,955
All this...

348
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:33,792
...everything that's happened, I...

349
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:38,547
I swear to God, Marie,
I think the universe...

350
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,466
...is trying to tell me something...

351
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:43,760
...and I'm finally...

352
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:46,930
...ready to listen.

353
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:57,983
I'm just not the man I thought I was.

354
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:03,822
I think I'm done as a cop.

355
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:20,047
Now, this is not an easy decision,
but it is one that I have to make.

356
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:21,924
I'm sorry.

357
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:27,012
This whole Gale situation, he's...

358
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:29,640
He's just not working out.

359
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:34,603
Yes, now.

360
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:37,814
It may sound unorthodox...

361
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:43,820
...but I think our first best option...

362
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:48,075
...is Jesse Pinkman.

363
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:53,330
Hello?

364
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:05,217
No, look. There's a shorthand
that exists between us...

365
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:07,135
...experience together...

366
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:12,850
...at a level that, quite frankly,
I'm just never going to reach with Gale.

367
00:32:17,521 --> 00:32:20,190
Look, Mr. Fring...

368
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:26,196
...when I accepted your offer,
I was told the lab is mine.

369
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:28,907
And I know best how to run it.

370
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:35,747
Thank you.

371
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,541
Thank you.

372
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:40,627
Yes, I will. I will.

373
00:32:40,836 --> 00:32:43,255
Okay. Goodbye.

374
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,139
<i>Listen, something's come up.</i>

375
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:56,518
I think it's a good opportunity.

376
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:02,065
There's been a job opening.

377
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:03,775
I need a new lab assistant.

378
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:09,281
I already did my time.

379
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,075
Why don't you just go get yourself
a monkey?

380
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,162
I don't want a monkey.

381
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,414
I want you.

382
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:19,958
Oh, gee, thanks.

383
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:22,419
Well, not interested.

384
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:26,423
I got my own thing going on.

385
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:30,677
And nice try, saving your asshead
brother-in-law.

386
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:37,559
That's not why I'm here, Jesse.

387
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:39,394
There's more.

388
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:43,649
It's more than an assistant.

389
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:45,776
Partners.

390
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:48,946
We'll be partners again.

391
00:33:49,154 --> 00:33:52,658
Split everything fifty-fifty,
just like before.

392
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:59,414
One-point-five million dollars each.

393
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:07,256
No.

394
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:18,225
- I don't think you heard...
- I heard you fine.

395
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:21,520
I said no.

396
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:26,775
Let me understand this.

397
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:31,113
You're turning down
one and a half million dollars...

398
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:34,908
I am not turning down the money.

399
00:34:35,117 --> 00:34:38,453
I am turning down you.

400
00:34:38,662 --> 00:34:40,539
You get it?

401
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:44,668
I want nothing to do with you.

402
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:48,589
Ever since I met you...

403
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:53,135
...everything I've... ever cared about...

404
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:55,429
...is gone.

405
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:59,141
Ruined, turned to shit...

406
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:04,730
...dead, ever since I hooked up
with the great Heisenberg.

407
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:09,151
I have never been more alone.

408
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,571
I have nothing!

409
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:14,781
No one!

410
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:17,784
All right? It's all gone!

411
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:19,745
Get it?

412
00:35:20,913 --> 00:35:21,997
No.

413
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:24,791
No, no. Why...?

414
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:29,213
Why would you get it?

415
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:35,844
What do you even care,
as long as you get what you want?

416
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:37,304
Right?

417
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:42,476
You don't give a shit about me.

418
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:46,980
You said I was no good.

419
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:49,775
I'm nothing!

420
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,403
Why would you want me, huh?

421
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:59,034
You said my meth is inferior, right?

422
00:35:59,618 --> 00:36:04,831
Right? Hey, you said my cook
was garbage!

423
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,334
Hey, screw you, man!

424
00:36:07,543 --> 00:36:09,878
Screw you.

425
00:36:14,967 --> 00:36:17,761
Your meth is good, Jesse.

426
00:36:18,178 --> 00:36:20,347
As good as mine.

427
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:20,282
Yeah.

428
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:23,994
<i>Fifty-fifty.</i>

429
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:26,997
Yes, fifty-fifty.

430
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:31,210
Okay.

431
00:37:32,044 --> 00:37:33,879
Partners.

432
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:41,720
Good.

433
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:33,188
And this is the statement
you want to give?

434
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:35,691
Yes, sir.

435
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:39,611
- Hank, you don't have to do this.
- No, I...

436
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:42,364
I do.

437
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:45,158
I'm good.

438
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:53,250
So we understand
if we write it up like that, you'll sign it.

439
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:57,212
That's the way it happened.

440
00:38:58,213 --> 00:39:00,174
I accept the consequences.

441
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,140
In the light of these facts...

442
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:11,643
...as of this moment,
you're suspended without pay.

443
00:39:12,144 --> 00:39:15,606
I have to ask you to hand over
your badge and your gun.

444
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:17,649
Yes, sir.

445
00:39:47,763 --> 00:39:49,431
Schrader.

446
00:39:49,973 --> 00:39:51,266
Hold up.

447
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:52,976
Yes, sir?

448
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:55,604
I just wanted to tell you something.

449
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:59,358
And you didn't hear it from me.
Don't want you to get your hopes up...

450
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:03,153
...but the word in the pipeline is
Pinkman isn't pressing charges.

451
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:08,116
- Why not?
- Who the hell knows?

452
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:11,620
Maybe you have a guardian angel.

453
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:35,477
It went fine.

454
00:40:36,395 --> 00:40:39,773
Well, fine means what it means,
yeah.

455
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:41,984
I'll...

456
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:45,320
I'll tell you all about it
when I get home, okay?

457
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:48,657
Yeah. It's...

458
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:50,826
Yeah, it's just...

459
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:52,911
I don't know, baby, I just think...

460
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,206
I think we may be okay. Yeah.

461
00:40:56,498 --> 00:40:58,792
Okay. I love you too.

462
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,150
- Schrader.
- <i>I need you to listen very carefully.</i>

463
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:25,402
<i>Two men are coming to kill you.</i>

464
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:26,987
Come again?

465
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:31,241
<i>They're approaching your car.</i>
<i>You have one minute.</i>

466
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:33,869
I don't get the gag, jagoff.
Who is this?

467
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:35,996
<i>They're coming.</i>

468
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:38,040
Hello?

469
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:54,056
Hey, li...

470
00:41:56,225 --> 00:42:01,146
Gomey, I don't know what that call was,
but it's dumb even by your standards...

471
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:03,398
...so call me when you get this.

472
00:44:04,853 --> 00:44:06,146
Finish him.

473
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:32,965
Jesus.

474
00:45:15,174 --> 00:45:16,925
No.

475
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,512
Too easy.

<i>Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...</i>

2
00:00:03,126 --> 00:00:05,140
I knew there would be
a drop in quality,

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,350
but, 68%?

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,404
This is not what I agreed to.

5
00:00:08,497 --> 00:00:10,724
I left a viable operation,

6
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,651
<i>the rest was up to you.</i>

7
00:00:14,503 --> 00:00:16,175
All along it was you!

8
00:00:16,314 --> 00:00:18,198
Hank, my cancer is back.

9
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:22,222
In six months you won't have
someone to prosecute.

10
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:24,654
Here. Take it.

12
00:04:49,692 --> 00:04:50,876
Mariano, it's me.

13
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,125
I need you to get Skyler
on the line.

14
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,466
No, no, I need you to get
her on the phone right now.

15
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,717
Tell her it's urgent.

16
00:05:01,888 --> 00:05:04,723
No-- What do you mean
she won't get off the phone?

17
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:07,142
I am giving you permission,
Mariano.

18
00:05:07,177 --> 00:05:08,927
You make her get off the phone.

19
00:05:15,885 --> 00:05:17,219
Mariano,

20
00:05:17,237 --> 00:05:19,688
who is Skyler
on the phone with?

21
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,452
Yeah.

22
00:05:36,372 --> 00:05:38,345
Okay.

23
00:05:54,524 --> 00:05:56,391
Where is she?
Where's Skyler?

24
00:05:56,425 --> 00:05:57,759
She just kinda left.

25
00:05:57,777 --> 00:06:00,195
She didn't say
where she was going.

26
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:56,767
Skyler, my--
my head is spinning.

27
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:00,455
And yours...

28
00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:03,875
I-- I can't even imagine.

29
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,664
So much makes sense to me now.

30
00:07:09,682 --> 00:07:11,099
You jumping in the pool,

31
00:07:11,134 --> 00:07:15,887
you sending us your kids,
I get it.

32
00:07:15,938 --> 00:07:19,975
I just wished
I'd seen it sooner.

33
00:07:22,345 --> 00:07:24,171
He's a monster.

34
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:27,459
He's a...

35
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:31,353
Look, I don't know
what he did to you

36
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:33,355
to force you
to keep his secrets.

37
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:34,706
If he threatened you,

38
00:07:34,741 --> 00:07:37,826
or whatever mind games
he played.

39
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,829
I don't know
if there was abuse.

40
00:07:40,863 --> 00:07:45,083
But I want you to know that
you can be open with me.

41
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:48,003
Don't hold anything back, okay?

42
00:07:48,037 --> 00:07:49,588
I mean, I don't even--

43
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,640
understand if you know
the full extent of this,

44
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:53,091
what he's done.

45
00:07:53,142 --> 00:07:57,399
Not just the meth cooking,
but the lives he's destroyed.

46
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:02,384
But, look,
that's all behind you.

47
00:08:02,402 --> 00:08:03,985
Starting now.

48
00:08:04,887 --> 00:08:07,111
You're done being his victim.

49
00:08:08,024 --> 00:08:10,742
Because here's what
we're gonna do.

50
00:08:10,777 --> 00:08:13,147
Sky.
Here's what we're gonna do.

51
00:08:14,447 --> 00:08:17,366
You and the kids are gonna
move back to our house

52
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,284
where you'll be safe,

53
00:08:19,335 --> 00:08:21,743
where he can't get to you.

54
00:08:22,538 --> 00:08:26,208
Hank, does Marie...

55
00:08:26,242 --> 00:08:29,711
No. No.
We'll get to that soon enough.

56
00:08:29,745 --> 00:08:33,048
It's just you and me
right now, okay?

57
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:37,252
Okay.

58
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,923
Before we, um, before
we get you back to the house,

59
00:08:41,941 --> 00:08:43,692
I...

60
00:08:43,726 --> 00:08:48,263
I'm gonna ask you to tell me
everything you can.

61
00:08:48,281 --> 00:08:50,432
Um, take as long as you like.

62
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,267
Just, uh,
start from the beginning

63
00:08:52,285 --> 00:08:56,037
when you first became aware
of Walt's activities,

64
00:08:56,072 --> 00:09:01,326
and just-- just try to be
as detailed as you can.

65
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:05,947
Uh, what--
Right-- right here?

66
00:09:05,965 --> 00:09:07,632
Right now?

67
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,167
Sure. Why not?

68
00:09:09,218 --> 00:09:11,136
While it's still fresh,
you know?

69
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,139
And just, uh,
just, uh, remember to, uh,

70
00:09:14,173 --> 00:09:16,791
just state your name
and the date before you start.

71
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:20,729
Hank, do...

72
00:09:20,763 --> 00:09:23,927
Do we have to--
have to do this right now?

73
00:09:25,985 --> 00:09:27,986
No, we-- we don't have
to do this right now.

74
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,662
No.

75
00:09:30,022 --> 00:09:31,639
But just here's the thing.

76
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:34,693
You see, I need something solid
that I can bring to my people.

77
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:36,695
A statement, on the record.

78
00:09:36,746 --> 00:09:39,614
So you testifying to Walt's
criminal activity,

79
00:09:39,648 --> 00:09:42,000
whatever you know,
goes a long, long way here.

80
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:44,002
Okay? I mean, you see,

81
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:46,204
building a case this big,
gathering all this evidence,

82
00:09:46,255 --> 00:09:47,789
enough to get a conviction,

83
00:09:47,823 --> 00:09:50,158
we're talking a long-haul
proposition here,

84
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:52,660
and I don't want that bastard
running out the clock.

85
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:53,828
But with your testimony--

86
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:56,664
Wait, what do you mean
running out the clock?

87
00:09:56,682 --> 00:10:00,352
His cancer.
His cancer's back.

88
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:02,518
So he said.

89
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:06,000
He didn't tell you?

90
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:09,194
Who's to say it's even true?

91
00:10:09,228 --> 00:10:12,013
Lying piece of shit.

92
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:15,517
Look, regardless,
I mean, we'll just assume.

93
00:10:15,535 --> 00:10:16,952
Fine. Okay?

94
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:18,286
You know what?
That son of a bitch

95
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:19,955
looks me in the eye and he says

96
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:22,503
if what I know is true, <i>if...</i>

97
00:10:22,742 --> 00:10:25,588
he'll be dead
before I can prove it.

98
00:10:25,694 --> 00:10:27,825
The balls
on that son of a--

99
00:10:28,498 --> 00:10:30,215
I got all these little pieces.

100
00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:32,250
They're all part
of the story, right?

101
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:33,868
But they don't mean
much on their own.

102
00:10:33,886 --> 00:10:35,637
But when you start
telling me what you know,

103
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:37,055
when you start
filling in the gaps,

104
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:40,473
I'll have him in lockup
before the sun goes down.

105
00:10:40,843 --> 00:10:44,022
Hank, I-- I...

106
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,565
I think maybe...

107
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:48,233
Maybe I need a lawyer.

108
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:50,060
What?

109
00:10:50,736 --> 00:10:52,220
No, no, no, no, you don't.

110
00:10:52,238 --> 00:10:54,940
I-- I think maybe I do.

111
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:57,359
Skyler, understand,
I am here to help you.

112
00:10:57,393 --> 00:10:59,828
But to do that,
I need your help.

113
00:10:59,862 --> 00:11:01,947
We start bringing in lawyers

114
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:04,165
and they start
putting up roadblocks

115
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,500
where they don't need to be,

116
00:11:05,535 --> 00:11:08,336
and my ability to control
this situation diminishes.

117
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:11,840
Just for my own protection,

118
00:11:11,874 --> 00:11:15,627
it just, you know,
it seems to make sense

119
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:18,462
that I should have
someone to talk to.

120
00:11:18,848 --> 00:11:21,916
Skyler, I'm your--
your biggest advocate here,

121
00:11:21,934 --> 00:11:24,102
and I'm telling you,
for your own good,

122
00:11:24,136 --> 00:11:26,311
you need to get out
ahead of this thing.

123
00:11:27,523 --> 00:11:31,393
I mean, you start,
you know, getting defensive,

124
00:11:31,427 --> 00:11:33,478
I-- I'm not saying
it's right,

125
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:35,196
but I'll tell you it's a fact,

126
00:11:35,231 --> 00:11:37,765
the DA will look
at you differently.

127
00:11:37,783 --> 00:11:39,734
But you don't know that.

128
00:11:39,768 --> 00:11:41,236
Skyler, yes, I-- I do.

129
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,204
I've been around
long enough to know.

130
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:44,990
It's in your best interest

131
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,491
to get out there
and show the world

132
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:48,461
you have nothing to hide.

133
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:51,786
Look...

134
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:57,344
no one in the world
is more important to me

135
00:11:58,004 --> 00:11:59,724
than your sister.

136
00:12:00,423 --> 00:12:03,592
So believe me when I tell you

137
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:09,180
that your best interest
and mine are the same.

138
00:12:09,565 --> 00:12:13,134
But, Hank, you telling me
not to talk to a lawyer

139
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:15,687
doesn't sound like that at all.

140
00:12:15,738 --> 00:12:19,320
It sounds like what you want...

141
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:24,582
What you want is to get Walt.

142
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:26,771
At all costs.

143
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,929
Okay.

144
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:32,320
Okay, let's just--

145
00:12:32,338 --> 00:12:35,094
Slow down. Slow down.

146
00:12:35,658 --> 00:12:37,325
You can...

147
00:12:37,343 --> 00:12:40,240
You can talk to a lawyer later.

148
00:12:41,714 --> 00:12:45,600
But right now,
what we need to do,

149
00:12:45,635 --> 00:12:47,218
we need to go get the kids,

150
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:50,472
we need to bring them
to my house where they're safe,

151
00:12:50,506 --> 00:12:52,840
and then we need
to help each other

152
00:12:52,858 --> 00:12:55,563
put this animal away, okay?

153
00:12:56,612 --> 00:12:57,612
Come on.

154
00:12:57,647 --> 00:12:59,648
- Hank.
- No, come on.

155
00:12:59,682 --> 00:13:00,982
Let's go to the house and we'll
deal with it there. Come on.

156
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:04,195
Am I under arrest?

157
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:06,454
What?

158
00:13:06,489 --> 00:13:09,741
Am I under arrest?

159
00:13:15,498 --> 00:13:18,049
Skyler, I-- I--
You're not thinking straight about this.

160
00:13:18,084 --> 00:13:20,552
You have to listen to me.
I-- Skyler.

161
00:13:20,586 --> 00:13:21,703
Skyler-- Skyler-- Skyler--

162
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:22,887
- Am I under arrest?
- No, no, no.

163
00:13:22,922 --> 00:13:24,255
- Am I under arrest?
- No. Sky-- shh.

164
00:13:24,306 --> 00:13:26,307
- Hank, are you arresting me?
- Sky--

165
00:13:26,342 --> 00:13:29,021
Am I under arrest?!

166
00:14:11,327 --> 00:14:13,445
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

167
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:19,737
I gotta do it, man.

168
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:27,183
Dude.

169
00:14:27,218 --> 00:14:28,493
Mm.

170
00:14:28,544 --> 00:14:30,679
What are you doing?
Huell.

171
00:14:30,713 --> 00:14:31,980
Hey, quit screwing around.

172
00:14:32,015 --> 00:14:33,048
Mm.

173
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:34,583
We are here to do a job,

174
00:14:34,617 --> 00:14:36,518
not channel Scrooge McDuck.

175
00:14:36,552 --> 00:14:38,086
You hearin' me?

176
00:14:38,121 --> 00:14:39,921
I hear ya.

177
00:14:39,956 --> 00:14:41,546
Dude.

178
00:14:41,824 --> 00:14:45,253
Mm, mm, mm.

179
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:47,161
Ah, screw it.

180
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:56,672
Mexico.

181
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:59,252
All's I'm saying.

182
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:04,780
Guy hit ten guys in jail

183
00:15:04,814 --> 00:15:06,531
within a two-minute window.

184
00:15:06,582 --> 00:15:09,055
All's I'm saying.

185
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:11,753
Yeah, it's me. Again.

186
00:15:11,788 --> 00:15:13,372
Listen, kid, you've got
to hide those bags.

187
00:15:13,423 --> 00:15:16,375
The monkey is in
the banana patch, <i>capisce?</i>

188
00:15:16,426 --> 00:15:18,960
So... call me.

189
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,762
This was the third message.

190
00:15:20,797 --> 00:15:22,647
Where the hell is that kid?

191
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:25,767
That's her.

192
00:15:25,802 --> 00:15:26,802
Don't.

193
00:15:26,836 --> 00:15:27,803
I have to talk to her.

194
00:15:27,837 --> 00:15:28,837
You don't have to do--

195
00:15:28,855 --> 00:15:30,022
You answer that phone

196
00:15:30,056 --> 00:15:31,723
and Schrader's on
the other end of the line

197
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:33,692
with a legal wire tap
recording everything you say,

198
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:34,693
you're not doing anybody
any favors.

199
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:35,977
Except for him.

200
00:15:36,011 --> 00:15:37,946
In fact, why do you still
have a battery in that thing?

201
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,284
Take it out.

202
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:42,234
They might be trying
to triangulate your movements.

203
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:44,857
I'm not being paranoid.
Do it.

204
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,373
Can't believe she went to him.

205
00:15:48,408 --> 00:15:49,691
She just panicked.

206
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:51,626
She went right to him
without even talking to me.

207
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:52,961
Without a moment's hesitation.

208
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,996
I'm not saying
it's not bad. It's bad.

209
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,415
But it could be worse.

210
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:59,033
Really.
How much worse could it be,

211
00:15:59,052 --> 00:16:00,552
exactly, in your estimation?

212
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:02,137
What does she actually know?

213
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:03,638
What has she seen, hmm?

214
00:16:03,673 --> 00:16:05,257
Nothing. It's hearsay.

215
00:16:05,308 --> 00:16:06,641
It's all he said, she said.

216
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:08,176
I mean, the only real evidence

217
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,145
that she can lead them
to is your money,

218
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:11,346
and once we take care of that,

219
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,182
well, then they got nothing.

220
00:16:14,216 --> 00:16:18,403
Nothing? Hank knows.
That's not nothing.

221
00:16:18,438 --> 00:16:23,265
Yeah. I can't exactly see him
turning the other cheek.

222
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:28,187
Of course there's always, um...

223
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,203
Always what?

224
00:16:32,902 --> 00:16:35,253
Well, have you
given any thought

225
00:16:35,288 --> 00:16:40,425
to, um, sending him
on a trip to Belize?

226
00:16:41,677 --> 00:16:43,428
Belize?

227
00:16:43,463 --> 00:16:45,097
Yeah. Belize.

228
00:16:45,131 --> 00:16:48,583
You know, where, uh,
where Mike went to.

229
00:16:48,601 --> 00:16:53,080
Off on a trip to, uh, Belize.

230
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:56,475
Saul, you better not be saying
what I think you're saying.

231
00:16:56,526 --> 00:16:57,943
It's just conjecture
on my part.

232
00:16:57,977 --> 00:16:59,611
Hank is family!

233
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:00,862
Okay, it's an option that--

234
00:17:00,897 --> 00:17:02,314
You understand that?

235
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:04,282
It's an option that has
worked very well for you

236
00:17:04,317 --> 00:17:05,567
in the recent past.

237
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:06,768
Jesus.
What is wrong with you?

238
00:17:06,786 --> 00:17:10,438
My mistake. Family.
Off limits. Of course.

239
00:17:10,456 --> 00:17:12,407
I'm just throwing
thoughts out there.

240
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:13,825
This is a safe room, right?

241
00:17:13,876 --> 00:17:15,777
Jesus.
Send him to Belize.

242
00:17:15,795 --> 00:17:17,756
I'll send you to Belize.

243
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:22,416
Finally.

244
00:17:27,957 --> 00:17:29,307
It's about time.

245
00:17:29,342 --> 00:17:30,509
Have you two been followed?

246
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,293
Are you sure?

247
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:34,996
If they had, we'd all
be in handcuffs right now.

248
00:17:42,972 --> 00:17:46,120
I, uh, took the tops off.

249
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:48,643
Figured you'd want to check to
make sure it's still all there.

250
00:17:48,661 --> 00:17:50,559
You figured right.

251
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:56,668
Close enough.

252
00:18:00,173 --> 00:18:02,156
Hey, if you need any help
on the other end.

253
00:18:02,175 --> 00:18:04,042
Yeah, these things are a
bitch to move on your own.

254
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:05,660
I'll manage.

255
00:18:05,678 --> 00:18:06,962
And we don't mind overtime.

256
00:18:06,996 --> 00:18:08,346
Ain't no thing.

257
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:22,727
Pay Huell and Kuby
and take your cut.

258
00:18:22,778 --> 00:18:25,981
The rest is mine.
Insurance in case I need you.

259
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:27,015
In case you need me?

260
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:29,067
I'm thinking
the probability is high.

261
00:18:29,118 --> 00:18:30,852
Just find Jesse.

262
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,695
Keys.

263
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,320
Saul Goodman, please.

264
00:19:55,371 --> 00:19:56,821
Skyler White.

265
00:19:56,872 --> 00:19:59,291
No, no, please-- please
don't tell me he isn't there.

266
00:19:59,325 --> 00:20:01,630
I know he's been
avoiding my calls.

267
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:06,050
All right, well, um,
has my husband been there?

268
00:20:06,632 --> 00:20:07,916
What do you mean
you don't know?

269
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,050
Either he has or he hasn't.

270
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:10,085
I don't--

271
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:15,702
Sweetie...

272
00:20:18,961 --> 00:20:19,961
Shit.

273
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:22,214
Sky.

274
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:28,136
Sky, I know you're home.

275
00:20:28,154 --> 00:20:31,081
Let me in.
Let me talk to you.

276
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,027
Skyler, I'm just gonna wait
here until you open the door,

277
00:20:36,078 --> 00:20:38,530
so let me in now
or three hours from now,

278
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:41,045
but I'm not leaving
until I see you.

279
00:20:42,335 --> 00:20:45,319
Skyler. Please.

280
00:20:53,262 --> 00:20:55,236
Just you.

281
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:58,337
Not Hank.

282
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:05,235
Tell me Hank is crazy.

283
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:10,528
Tell me he doesn't know
what he's talking about.

284
00:21:15,618 --> 00:21:18,036
You gotta give me
something, Skyler.

285
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,842
Anything to help me understand.

286
00:21:22,191 --> 00:21:23,935
It can't be true.

287
00:21:35,421 --> 00:21:37,255
Oh, my God.

288
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:52,095
How long have you known?

289
00:21:52,655 --> 00:21:56,324
Hank said that when
you walked into the pool,

290
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,059
that's when you knew.

291
00:21:58,077 --> 00:21:59,690
When you had your...

292
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:08,286
But not then.
Before that.

293
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,842
Since Gus Fring?

294
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:19,347
The money.

295
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:21,680
All that money that Walt made,

296
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:25,103
when you bought your car wash.

297
00:22:28,423 --> 00:22:31,352
And your whole gambling story.

298
00:22:33,762 --> 00:22:35,740
- That was a lie.
- I...

299
00:22:37,817 --> 00:22:39,861
Did you know then?

300
00:22:46,242 --> 00:22:48,238
You had to.

301
00:22:52,882 --> 00:22:54,902
Skyler...

302
00:22:59,722 --> 00:23:03,258
did you know
since before Hank was shot?

303
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:09,576
Skyler?

304
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,696
Marie.

305
00:23:18,307 --> 00:23:20,975
I am so sorry.

306
00:23:20,993 --> 00:23:23,495
You're sorry...

307
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:25,479
You're...

308
00:23:25,498 --> 00:23:26,985
I'm--

309
00:23:29,418 --> 00:23:33,321
You won't talk...
You won't talk to Hank

310
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:36,457
because you think that Walt
is going to get away with this.

311
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:42,299
Oh, God.

312
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,799
Come on. Let's go.

313
00:23:56,862 --> 00:23:59,314
Come on, baby. Come on.

314
00:23:59,348 --> 00:24:02,289
- Let's go.
- Marie. Marie. Hey.

315
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:03,818
- What are you doing?
- Hey, hey, hey.

316
00:24:03,852 --> 00:24:04,852
What are you doing?

317
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:05,870
She's coming with us.

318
00:24:05,905 --> 00:24:07,572
No, she is not.
Give her back to me.

319
00:24:07,623 --> 00:24:08,963
Marie.

320
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:13,694
Hank. Hank, help.
Come and help.

321
00:24:13,712 --> 00:24:16,697
You are not leaving this
house with my daughter.

322
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:18,082
Give her back to me.

323
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:20,134
Marie.
Give her back to me.

324
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:21,219
Stop it.

325
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:22,220
You're scaring her.

326
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:23,221
Marie.
Give her back to me.

327
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:24,372
I'm trying to protect her.

328
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,224
Protect her? How dare you?
I'm her mother.

329
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:27,872
She's not gonna live
in this madhouse!

330
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,877
You do not know
what you're talking about!

331
00:24:29,895 --> 00:24:30,878
Give her back to me!

332
00:24:30,896 --> 00:24:31,879
- Marie...
- Hank, you have to help me.

333
00:24:31,897 --> 00:24:32,931
Listen, I will call the police.

334
00:24:32,982 --> 00:24:34,933
You call them.
You call them, Skyler.

335
00:24:34,984 --> 00:24:36,684
I will.
Give me my baby.

336
00:24:36,718 --> 00:24:37,718
Marie, put her down.

337
00:24:37,736 --> 00:24:39,237
I am not leaving
here without her.

338
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:40,405
Marie.

339
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:41,406
Give me my baby.

340
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,241
Skyler, we are not
leaving without her.

341
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:45,059
Give me my baby right now!

342
00:24:45,077 --> 00:24:46,911
Marie!

343
00:24:46,946 --> 00:24:48,598
Do it now.

344
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:52,283
Give her back.

345
00:24:56,505 --> 00:24:58,739
That's right.
It's okay. It's okay.

346
00:24:58,757 --> 00:25:02,594
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

347
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:04,629
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

348
00:25:11,753 --> 00:25:13,554
Okay, mama has you now.

349
00:25:13,588 --> 00:25:14,973
Mama has you now.

350
00:25:15,024 --> 00:25:17,308
Mama has you. Shh.

351
00:25:23,782 --> 00:25:24,782
It's okay.

352
00:25:24,817 --> 00:25:26,818
It's okay, it's okay.

353
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:28,602
It's okay. It's okay.

354
00:25:49,141 --> 00:25:51,188
You have to get him.

355
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:34,167
34, 59, 20.
106, 36, 52.

356
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:38,555
34, 59, 20.
106, 36, 52.

357
00:27:40,475 --> 00:27:46,463
34, 59, 20.
106, 36, 52.

358
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:52,686
34, 59, 20.
106, 36, 52.

359
00:27:54,405 --> 00:28:00,327
34, 59, 20.
106, 36, 52.

360
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:30,233
Walt.

361
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,327
Where have you been?

362
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:50,721
Oh, my God.

363
00:28:52,663 --> 00:28:55,099
What happened?

364
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,344
You moved the money,
didn't you?

365
00:29:07,362 --> 00:29:09,593
You buried it somewhere.

366
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,816
Did you get my messages?

367
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,489
I told Hank nothing.

368
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:25,045
Walt. I swear I didn't.

369
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:29,032
Say something.

370
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,637
Please.

371
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:39,760
Oh, my God.

372
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,513
Walt. Walt.

373
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:13,010
How-- how long was I out?

374
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:15,579
Oh, about four or five hours.

375
00:30:15,597 --> 00:30:17,047
Oh.

376
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:18,882
How are you feeling?

377
00:30:27,758 --> 00:30:29,704
It's true.

378
00:30:32,647 --> 00:30:34,648
The cancer's back.

379
00:30:44,993 --> 00:30:47,777
Is this it?

380
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,508
Does that make you happy?

381
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:07,464
I can't remember
the last time I was happy.

382
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:20,080
Just tell me.

383
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,630
I know you talked with Hank.

384
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:28,561
I know you made a deal.

385
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:32,355
Skyler, I'll make this easy.

386
00:31:32,823 --> 00:31:35,325
I'll give myself up.

387
00:31:35,343 --> 00:31:38,120
If you promise me one thing.

388
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:42,365
You keep the money.

389
00:31:42,684 --> 00:31:45,578
Never speak of it.

390
00:31:45,853 --> 00:31:48,555
Never give it up.

391
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:52,442
You pass it on to our children.

392
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:55,896
Give them everything.

393
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,387
Will you do that?

394
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:06,113
Please?

395
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:11,378
Please don't let me
have done all this for nothing.

396
00:32:22,873 --> 00:32:26,216
How did Hank find out?

397
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:29,229
Did-- did somebody talk?

398
00:32:29,263 --> 00:32:31,481
No, no one talked.

399
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,436
It was me.

400
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,211
I screwed up.

401
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:49,107
The way Hank talks...

402
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:53,691
he's got his suspicions.

403
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,908
Not much else.

404
00:33:04,465 --> 00:33:05,932
You can't give yourself up

405
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:08,218
without giving up the money.

406
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:12,085
It's the way this works, Walt.

407
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:16,308
So maybe our best move here

408
00:33:16,978 --> 00:33:20,601
is to stay quiet.

409
00:33:58,186 --> 00:34:00,737
Okay, you can take it off now.

410
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:29,032
All right, what's so important

411
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:30,467
you had to come
all the way out here?

412
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,052
For the amount of money
I'm bringing in,

413
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:36,602
I think I deserve to see exactly
why it's all going so wrong.

414
00:34:37,525 --> 00:34:38,859
Are you an expert
on meth labs now?

415
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:42,824
Are you gonna tell us
how to fix our operation?

416
00:34:42,864 --> 00:34:44,514
And what if I can help?

417
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:46,399
What will it hurt to show me?

418
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:49,352
I-- I don't like
my time being wasted.

419
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,288
Well, I'm here,

420
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:54,458
and ten minutes
is a small sacrifice

421
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:57,918
when we're talking about
a $50 million shortfall.

422
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,186
So?

423
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,748
Safe to come down?

424
00:35:34,782 --> 00:35:37,200
Yeah. You're good.

425
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,243
Ladies first.

426
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,904
Okay, now you've seen it.

427
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:17,096
Yep. Now I've seen it.

428
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:19,910
What?

429
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:23,446
Well, how about
we start with it's filthy?

430
00:36:23,464 --> 00:36:24,447
What are you, my mother?

431
00:36:24,465 --> 00:36:26,466
What, filthy?
It's just dimly lit.

432
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,470
Do you seriously think this is up to
the standards of your predecessor?

433
00:36:30,504 --> 00:36:32,789
Because it's not.
Not even close.

434
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:34,290
Yeah, well,
the product we're making,

435
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:36,176
it's selling just fine.

436
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,127
Heisenberg's standards
don't matter anymore.

437
00:36:38,145 --> 00:36:41,565
To whom? A bunch
of scabby Arizona tweakers?

438
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,133
They matter to my buyer
in the Czech Republic,

439
00:36:44,151 --> 00:36:45,185
I can tell you that.

440
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,436
Therefore, they matter to me.

441
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,155
Look, I cannot move
what this person is making

442
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,640
if it's substandard.

443
00:36:50,658 --> 00:36:52,308
And it is.
It just is.

444
00:36:52,326 --> 00:36:53,827
No offense.

445
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:55,445
You can do better, do better.

446
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,330
Yeah, I don't know
what to tell you.

447
00:36:57,365 --> 00:36:59,115
I mean, you tried
to get the man back, right?

448
00:36:59,149 --> 00:37:01,785
He said no, so I mean,
what do you want me to do?

449
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:04,754
Todd. Use Todd again.

450
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:08,708
Look, he learned from him,
all right?

451
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:11,995
At least Todd's
first two cooks were at 74%.

452
00:37:12,013 --> 00:37:14,097
On his third cook,
he started a fire.

453
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,516
Look, I tried Heisenberg's way.

454
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,550
It didn't work out.

455
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,052
I wanna cook in my territory,

456
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,637
I wanna use guys that I trust,

457
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,839
not Todd, who I don't.

458
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:24,391
And that's the end
of the conversation

459
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:25,475
as far as I'm concerned.

460
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:34,335
I really wish you'd
have given him a chance.

461
00:37:34,402 --> 00:37:36,921
Hey.
We have a problem.

462
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,650
You stay here.

463
00:38:35,596 --> 00:38:38,848
Hello? Ma'am, you okay?

464
00:38:44,939 --> 00:38:46,922
Hello?

465
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,604
Safe to come up
whenever you want.

466
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:17,637
I...
I don't want to see.

467
00:39:17,671 --> 00:39:20,090
Okay.

468
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:24,144
Cool, so I guess maybe, um...

469
00:39:24,178 --> 00:39:26,146
Maybe just close your eyes?

470
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,442
Okay.

471
00:39:39,476 --> 00:39:41,528
This way.

472
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,638
To your right.

473
00:39:56,544 --> 00:39:58,966
Are you kidding me with this?

474
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,799
Uncle Jack.

475
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:15,779
Fire in the hole.

476
00:40:17,198 --> 00:40:20,533
It's okay.
Sorry about that.

477
00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:23,914
It's cool, lady.

478
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:34,430
Okay, boys.
Let's take it all.

479
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,232
Let's get everything.

480
00:41:01,866 --> 00:41:03,543
Hey.

481
00:41:04,652 --> 00:41:06,686
You, uh...

482
00:41:06,737 --> 00:41:09,220
going into work today?

483
00:41:11,158 --> 00:41:13,826
You're kidding, right?

484
00:41:19,032 --> 00:41:21,033
What about you?

485
00:41:24,088 --> 00:41:27,086
Are you going to the office?

486
00:41:29,476 --> 00:41:32,412
You have to tell them, Hank.

487
00:41:32,479 --> 00:41:34,147
Today.

488
00:41:34,215 --> 00:41:38,285
Marie, I just--
just don't have it yet.

489
00:41:38,586 --> 00:41:40,286
The piece I need
to prove it all,

490
00:41:40,354 --> 00:41:42,322
it's just--
it's just not here.

491
00:41:42,389 --> 00:41:44,357
Then let them help you.

492
00:41:44,425 --> 00:41:46,826
Tell Steve, tell Ramey.

493
00:41:46,894 --> 00:41:49,929
You've got enough to get them
to believe your story at least.

494
00:41:49,997 --> 00:41:52,198
Put the whole DEA on it.

495
00:41:52,249 --> 00:41:54,834
That's how this
is supposed to work, right?

496
00:41:54,901 --> 00:41:56,786
No.

497
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:00,206
No? What no?

498
00:42:00,257 --> 00:42:01,591
What are you,
Lone Wolf McQuade?

499
00:42:01,675 --> 00:42:02,875
Look, baby--

500
00:42:02,927 --> 00:42:04,761
You've gotta go in
with this, Hank.

501
00:42:04,845 --> 00:42:07,969
Look,
the day I go in with this,

502
00:42:09,617 --> 00:42:12,151
that's the last day
of my career, all right?

503
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:14,304
I'm going to have
to walk in there,

504
00:42:14,388 --> 00:42:17,326
look those people in the eye,

505
00:42:18,091 --> 00:42:21,027
and admit that the person
I've been chasing the past year

506
00:42:21,094 --> 00:42:23,929
is my own brother-in-law?

507
00:42:28,736 --> 00:42:30,703
It's over for me.

508
00:42:34,074 --> 00:42:36,576
Ten seconds
after I tell this story,

509
00:42:36,627 --> 00:42:37,943
I'm a civilian.

510
00:42:37,995 --> 00:42:40,296
And then
how can we help Skyler?

511
00:42:40,381 --> 00:42:43,465
If she comes to her senses.

512
00:42:43,968 --> 00:42:46,669
When I go in there...

513
00:42:46,754 --> 00:42:51,474
I'm bringing proof,
not suspicions.

514
00:42:56,096 --> 00:42:59,482
I can be the man
who caught him. At least.

515
00:42:59,566 --> 00:43:01,651
What if you wait...

516
00:43:01,735 --> 00:43:03,853
and they catch Walt
without you?

517
00:43:03,937 --> 00:43:07,940
If they find out that you
knew and you said nothing?

518
00:43:07,992 --> 00:43:10,476
Hank, wouldn't you
go to jail too?

519
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:21,254
Hey, Hank.
Welcome back.

520
00:43:21,321 --> 00:43:23,322
Morning.

521
00:43:23,374 --> 00:43:25,253
Hey.

522
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:30,546
Hey.

523
00:43:46,179 --> 00:43:48,013
Hey. Look who's back.

524
00:43:48,065 --> 00:43:50,349
I had to see it
with my own eyes.

525
00:43:50,401 --> 00:43:51,517
How you doing?

526
00:43:51,568 --> 00:43:53,653
Good. Yeah, yeah.
You miss me?

527
00:43:53,704 --> 00:43:56,289
Miss you? Like my balls
miss jock itch, maybe.

528
00:43:56,356 --> 00:43:57,540
I didn't know you had balls.

529
00:43:57,624 --> 00:43:59,792
All right, don't make me
sorry I stopped by here.

530
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:03,379
Anyway, uh, you got
a budget meeting in an hour,

531
00:44:03,464 --> 00:44:04,714
and then
you got a meet and greet

532
00:44:04,798 --> 00:44:07,133
with the new Prescription
Taskforce guys, all right?

533
00:44:07,201 --> 00:44:08,551
All right.

534
00:44:08,635 --> 00:44:12,338
Hey, uh, you know, listen.

535
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:17,110
Let's see if we can get
that budget meeting pushed,

536
00:44:17,177 --> 00:44:19,445
and instead see
if you could set up

537
00:44:19,513 --> 00:44:21,848
a conference call with Ramey.

538
00:44:21,915 --> 00:44:23,416
What for?

539
00:44:23,484 --> 00:44:26,185
Just a "getting back
up to speed" thing.

540
00:44:26,236 --> 00:44:28,237
You know, for me.

541
00:44:28,322 --> 00:44:30,690
All right. You got it.

542
00:44:30,741 --> 00:44:34,771
Oh, hey. Did you hear
about that money thing?

543
00:44:35,228 --> 00:44:36,529
No, what-- what money thing?

544
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,947
Oh, you're gonna love this.

545
00:44:38,031 --> 00:44:40,988
It involves your old pal
Jesse Pinkman.

546
00:44:41,502 --> 00:44:43,453
Pinkman?

547
00:44:43,537 --> 00:44:45,288
I'll give you this.

548
00:44:45,372 --> 00:44:47,457
Jesse, you're never boring.

549
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:49,459
Not boring at all.

550
00:44:49,543 --> 00:44:53,379
So come on, buddy.
Share with us.

551
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:55,848
Why were you tossing
millions of dollars

552
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:57,633
all over Albuquerque?

553
00:44:57,718 --> 00:44:59,936
I promise you we can hold out

554
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,771
just as long as you can.

555
00:45:01,855 --> 00:45:03,022
That's a fact.

556
00:45:03,089 --> 00:45:05,057
I got a bladder the size
of a hot water bottle.

557
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:07,226
Yeah. All that cash?

558
00:45:07,277 --> 00:45:09,729
- I wouldn't be able to stop
talking about it. - I know, right?

559
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,814
But I don't think I'd be
tossing it out my car window.

560
00:45:11,899 --> 00:45:13,783
My take-home
definitely doesn't allow

561
00:45:13,867 --> 00:45:15,735
for that whole
Robin Hood thing.

562
00:45:15,786 --> 00:45:18,121
But apparently Jesse here
is just raking it in.

563
00:45:18,205 --> 00:45:20,873
- Yes, indeed.
- And I'm sure he's got

564
00:45:20,941 --> 00:45:22,909
a perfectly reasonable
explanation for where he got it.

565
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,944
He found it.

566
00:45:24,995 --> 00:45:26,379
Or won it in
a card game, maybe.

567
00:45:26,446 --> 00:45:28,297
That's it.
Won it in a card game.

568
00:45:28,382 --> 00:45:30,383
Lucky night at the casino.

569
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:33,823
Jesse, did you have
a lucky night?

570
00:45:38,509 --> 00:45:41,144
Okay. Jesse, we're gonna let
you gather your thoughts

571
00:45:41,228 --> 00:45:43,513
so we can continue
this stimulating conversation.

572
00:45:43,597 --> 00:45:45,815
Can we get you anything?

573
00:45:45,899 --> 00:45:48,518
Coffee? A soda?
Right.

574
00:45:49,736 --> 00:45:52,680
Yeah. Thought not.

575
00:46:02,916 --> 00:46:05,918
I have a history
with Jesse Pinkman,

576
00:46:05,986 --> 00:46:09,672
and I think he can be helpful to me
on another active investigation.

577
00:46:09,756 --> 00:46:13,606
Look, I'm only asking
for a couple minutes here.

578
00:46:14,044 --> 00:46:15,962
You said he wasn't talking?

579
00:46:16,013 --> 00:46:18,764
Let me tell you,
that kid hates my guts.

580
00:46:18,832 --> 00:46:21,166
Despises me, okay?

581
00:46:21,218 --> 00:46:23,936
Maybe I can get him cranked up
enough that he starts yapping.

582
00:46:24,004 --> 00:46:27,557
Then you guys go in there, get what
you need from the little shit-stain,

583
00:46:27,641 --> 00:46:30,088
finish him off.

584
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:32,979
Gives me anything useful
while he's with me, I'll share it,

585
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:35,308
100%.

586
00:46:35,849 --> 00:46:38,618
I could use a smoke break.
Yeah. How about you?

587
00:46:38,685 --> 00:46:42,054
Yeah. Maybe you could keep an
eye on our suspect for us,

588
00:46:42,122 --> 00:46:43,873
- just for a few minutes.
- Absolutely.

589
00:46:43,957 --> 00:46:45,575
I can do that.

590
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:46,692
Okay.

591
00:46:46,743 --> 00:46:48,386
Thank you, guys.

592
00:47:05,145 --> 00:47:08,391

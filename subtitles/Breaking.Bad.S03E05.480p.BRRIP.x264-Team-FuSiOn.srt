1
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,009
I am awake.

2
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:14,681
You are not how I remember you
from class. I mean, like, not at all.

3
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,693
Dude, this isn't even 7 grand, all right?
My guy wants 85.

4
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:31,281
This is all the money I have
in the world.

5
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,826
You are a drug dealer. Negotiate.

6
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,163
Buy the RV.

7
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,625
We start tomorrow.

8
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,638
Work it, work it, baby.
Yo, this is sick, brother.

9
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,390
Totally. God.

10
00:00:56,598 --> 00:01:01,520
Yo, Jesse, I got these two fine ladies
who wanna participate.

11
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,898
- You got the funds?
- Oh, I got the funds. Hey.

12
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:07,526
Would you ladies like to meet
my fat stack?

13
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,029
Get in here.

14
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:14,074
Come on.

15
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:15,993
Hey, yo, yo.

16
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,246
Yo, you got champagne?
None of that cheap stuff.

17
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,249
I want the... expensive shit.
Don Pérignon.

18
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,792
It's 400 a bottle.

19
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:27,462
Oh, well, in that case,
I'll only have two.

20
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:31,884
Oh, and I want the tall, skinny glasses.
I like those skinny glasses.

21
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:36,638
That's what James Bond drinks.
Mofos, I'm all about that.

22
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:40,642
Yo, Jesse, man, I gotta ask.

23
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:44,938
- Where did you get all the cheddar?
- Must be moving mad volume.

24
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:47,107
It's funny.
You wanna know what's funny?

25
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,985
- What's funny?
- This old dude, he gave it to me.

26
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:51,361
- What?
- He gave it to me.

27
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,113
It's his entire life savings.

28
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:57,117
- What? Why?
- Because he's a dumb-ass. That's why.

29
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:58,744
Oh, God.

30
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,623
Yes!

31
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,417
All right, living large, players.

32
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,317
Thank you. Yo, thank you.

33
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:17,322
- Thank you.
- That was...

34
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,205
Awesome, bro.

35
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,708
Later.

36
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,043
Oh, man.

37
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,588
Oh, I'm so dead.

38
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:36,341
I only got... Oh, damn.

39
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,222
I only got, like, 1400.

40
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,893
Waffle House? Yeah.

41
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,978
No, man.

42
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,315
Supposed to use that dude's money
to buy an RV.

43
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:56,570
- What do you want with a RV for?
- Because, like...

44
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:58,822
Because, like...

45
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,491
Never mind.

46
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,910
Jesus.

47
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:08,749
Now I gotta, like, leave town
or change my identity or something.

48
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,460
Guy's blackmailing me.

49
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:16,215
He's got, like, a criminal mind, yo.

50
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,383
RV, yeah?

51
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:22,596
I can hook you up, bro.
I can totally get you an RV.

52
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:28,143
- No, I need it today. Now.
- No problem. Let's go.

53
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:31,772
You're telling me
you can get me an RV?

54
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,024
For 1400, at 6 in the morning?

55
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,944
Right on.

56
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,946
So do I need to sign something?

57
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,616
No, it's, like,
a no-paperwork-type deal.

58
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,248
Pleasure doing business with you.

59
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,626
Come on, we gotta bounce.

60
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,879
- What?
- For real, yo. Get it out of here.

61
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,558
Oh, my God, I love this floor.

62
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:36,063
This feels fantastic.

63
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,774
Can you control the temperature?

64
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,611
Yeah. There should be a switch
right next to you there.

65
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,072
It's a thermostat.

66
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:54,248
Ted, this has gotta be...

67
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:58,669
...the most amazing invention ever.

68
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,922
I know. Contractor talked me into it.

69
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,218
Seemed kind of extravagant, but...

70
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:10,013
I gotta tell you, once you try it,
you can't go back.

71
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,060
I can never find anything
in this Buick.

72
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,150
You know, you could leave
a few things here if you want.

73
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,428
- Why don't you go get your dad?
- Sure.

74
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:58,812
Hey, Dad.

75
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,066
- Dad?
- Yeah.

76
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:05,819
Mom's asking.

77
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,030
Wanna come to dinner?

78
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,949
Yeah, I'll be right there.

79
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,166
You're not listening to me.
I don't know.

80
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,502
<i>Yeah, right, lik e you don't know.</i>

81
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,046
- What did I just say?
- Give me the phone. Give it.

82
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,424
Like you didn't make some deal
behind my back.

83
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,384
<i>Correct. I did not.</i>

84
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,386
I was sitting at a stoplight...

85
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,598
...minding my own business,
when the man... The man...

86
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,893
The kid threw a bag of money
through my window.

87
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,062
Whatever, man.
You owe me that money.

88
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,022
- Let me talk to him.
<i>- I owe you?</i>

89
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:44,107
I owe you nothing.

90
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,527
And I will get to the bottom of this.
Trust me.

91
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,695
Trust you? Trust you?
That's a good one.

92
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,405
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

93
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:53,450
You wanna talk about trust, Jesse?
Let's talk about trust.

94
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:57,287
I told you not to cook my formula,
and you went ahead and did it anyway.

95
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:00,999
Because I never said I wouldn't cook it
because it ain't yours. It's ours.

96
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,251
Plural, bitch.

97
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,254
You did not have my permission.

98
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,090
All I know is I got half the money
I'm due...

99
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,758
...and you got the rest.

100
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,552
Escalating. You're... escalating.

101
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,389
You know what? Escalate this.
My meth, my money!

102
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:20,853
<i>I will be a one-man glass factory.</i>
<i>I will rock that RV 24...</i>

103
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:27,961
It's buttoned up tight.
Can't see a damn thing.

104
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,880
I ain't feeling it.

105
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:34,510
No smoke, no smell, no waste.
There's no cook.

106
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:38,764
Could be they're setting up.
I heard movement inside.

107
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:42,059
I say we call it a night,
come back with a search warrant.

108
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,937
I'm not letting this sucker
out of my sight.

109
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,523
There's gotta be a way.

110
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:51,568
There's gotta be a way.
There's gotta be a way...

111
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:58,534
Hey, hey, hey.

112
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,319
What are you doing?

113
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:53,755
- No, no, no.
- What the hell are you doing up there?

114
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:56,633
Are you some kind of a pe... rt?

115
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:59,761
Yeah,
because we were here last year.

116
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:03,515
Sorry. I appreciate...

117
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:05,976
Going after the bad guys.

118
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:11,064
I'm sorry and enjoy the rest
of your vacation. Okay?

119
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,449
Go back to your trailers.
Everything's okay.

120
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,496
Guy's VFW. He's cool.

121
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:29,458
We're gonna check out a couple more
and call it a morning.

122
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,211
- Okay, what do you say?
- Can't. Gotta get home.

123
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,547
Why, you leave your balls
in your wife's purse or what?

124
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,549
Gotta pack.

125
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,761
Where you headed?

126
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,431
Texas.

127
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:05,702
Hey there.

128
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,665
Hank?

129
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,753
Hank?

130
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,683
Can I come in?

131
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,812
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

132
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,148
- How did it go last night?
- Good.

133
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,317
Catch the bad guys?

134
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,070
Nope.

135
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,533
- Want me to make you some breakfast?
- No. I'm...

136
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,286
I'm heading back out after this.

137
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,664
Now? You worked all night.

138
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:53,584
Get some sleep, Hank.
Those RVs aren't going anywhere.

139
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:57,504
They're recreational vehicles, Marie.
That's what they do.

140
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:59,506
You know what I mean.

141
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,510
I spoke with Blanca.

142
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:08,473
She said
that Steven's going to El Paso?

143
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,728
Yeah.

144
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:17,274
I was just wondering
how you feel about that.

145
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:21,737
- I turned it down. End of story.
- Good. Good.

146
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,572
Jesus, God knows I'm relieved.

147
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,034
I needed some time here because
I'm deep into this investigation...

148
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,661
...and couldn't do both...

149
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,122
...so I made a judgement call.

150
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,049
You know that you can talk to me
about things, right?

151
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,843
You don't have
to go through this alone.

152
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,473
Do you ask me which lead bib
to put on someone...

153
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,308
...before you nuke them?

154
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:52,935
Jesus, Marie.

155
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:57,606
I made a decision.
I'm not going through anything.

156
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,858
Doing my job.

157
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,444
- I would like...
- I know. I know.

158
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,238
A condo in Georgetown. I know.

159
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:08,158
If you would let me finish,
I was going to say...

160
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:12,496
...I'd like to be included. That's all.

161
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:16,708
Don't you worry about my career.
My career is just fine.

162
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,754
Did you not wanna go?

163
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:24,842
I don't blame you. I just...

164
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,303
- Aren't you late for work or something?
- After what happened...

165
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:31,390
...it would make perfect sense
for you to not wanna go back.

166
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,059
I'm onto some important stuff
right here, right now.

167
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:38,230
And Mexico doesn't have a damn thing
to do with it. Anyone who doubts that...

168
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,566
I mean, I'm doing
some actual good out here...

169
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,944
...and all I get
are these bullshit accusations!

170
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:47,114
What, everyone thinks
I'm jerking off on this thing? Fine.

171
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,032
But I'm onto something. I know it.

172
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:51,326
You understand me?

173
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,871
You hear me?

174
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,548
What exactly is this?

175
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:11,972
I'll tell you what I think it is.

176
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:18,395
A ploy.
A ploy to get me cooking again.

177
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:20,147
And an obvious one at that.

178
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,274
How do you mean?

179
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:27,988
As if I would seriously believe
you would hire an addict.

180
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:30,616
Jesse Pinkman? Recovering or not.

181
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,911
You vouched for him previously.
I took you at your word.

182
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:38,874
No. No, no, no. Let me be clear.
Let me be perfectly clear.

183
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:43,045
Jesse was capable of working
under my supervision.

184
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:47,591
Trusting him with a solo venture...

185
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:51,094
...well, that's quite another matter.

186
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,681
How he could possibly
produce anything...

187
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,851
...other than a mediocre product
at best.

188
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,522
I am told his product
was more or less consistent...

189
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,399
...with the quality I had come to expect.

190
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:06,985
More or less?

191
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:10,614
More or less? Really?

192
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:16,745
Boy, that is the...
Talk about setting the bar low.

193
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:23,669
Except you don't do that,
set the bar low.

194
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:30,217
Therefore,
what conclusion am I left to draw?

195
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,722
That you believe I have some
proprietary kind of selfishness...

196
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:38,058
...about my own formula.

197
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,730
Some sort of overweening pride,
I suppose...

198
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:48,694
...that you think
simply overwhelms me...

199
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:51,613
...clouds my judgement.

200
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:55,409
- But it doesn't.
- Absolutely not.

201
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:58,412
I simply respect the chemistry.

202
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,168
The chemistry must be respected.

203
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:09,131
I apologise for being so transparent.

204
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:17,639
Would you take a drive with me?
I'd like to show you something.

205
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:02,768
Hi. Is everything okay?

206
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:06,355
She's already finished an entire bottle,
but she still seemed hungry.

207
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:08,023
Then she fell asleep.

208
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:11,109
But I was thinking I'd give her another
when she wakes up.

209
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,320
Yeah, yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

210
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:16,949
- Fatten that baby up.
<i>- Will do.</i>

211
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:23,497
Was that it?

212
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:25,832
So where are you? Are you at work?

213
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:29,545
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I'm at work.</i>
<i>I shouldn't be much longer.</i>

214
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:33,257
<i>- Is that okay?</i>
- You know I love my little pookums.

215
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,801
You can leave her with me
for the next 18 years...

216
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:37,970
...as far as I'm concerned.

217
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:41,849
Great. Thanks, Marie.

218
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,479
Are you sure you're okay?

219
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:52,609
<i>Sweetie, what is it? Come on.</i>

220
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:56,947
- It's Hank.
<i>- Hank? What about him?</i>

221
00:19:57,114 --> 00:20:02,327
I don't know how to talk to him.

222
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:06,248
I don't know what to say to him
anymore. I don't know how to...

223
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:11,587
Ever since El Paso, ever since...
Maybe before...

224
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:16,383
Yeah. God knows
he went through a lot down there.

225
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:20,929
People blown up right in front of him,
blood everywhere...

226
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:25,392
...and last week,
El Paso said they want him back.

227
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:26,602
<i>Yeah?</i>

228
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:30,606
He's not going. Steve Gomez
is going in his place...

229
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:34,902
...and I don't know
how I feel about that.

230
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:38,238
Well, he's certainly a lot safer up here,
isn't he?

231
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:42,201
<i>Of course, and I want him safe.</i>

232
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:46,622
But I can't tell what he wants.
He won't talk to me.

233
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:49,708
He hardly even comes home.
He works all day, all night.

234
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:52,586
Barely eats, barely speaks to me.

235
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:55,714
<i>It's lik e something's</i>
<i>eating him away from inside.</i>

236
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:59,801
He's just not the same. He's not.

237
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:05,516
Facing death, it changes a person.
It has to, don't you think?

238
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:09,645
I guess you've noticed
a change in Walt.

239
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:42,886
Please.

240
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:01,006
What is this?

241
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:05,511
Your new lab.

242
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:45,092
My God.

243
00:23:55,936 --> 00:24:00,941
Thorium oxide for a catalyst bed.

244
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:06,697
Look at the size
of this reaction vessel.

245
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:11,034
Oh, it's got...
It's gotta be 1200 litres.

246
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:15,372
Where...? Where...?

247
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:19,751
How did you know
how to put this all together?

248
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,672
I had excellent help, as will you.

249
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:29,219
Quite a lot of planning went into this.

250
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:31,763
I would say so.

251
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,809
The laundry upstairs,
I've owned it for years.

252
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:38,937
It receives large chemical deliveries
on a weekly basis...

253
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:40,439
...detergents and such.

254
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:43,567
There is nothing suspicious
about it...

255
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:48,697
...and my employees, to be sure,
are well-trained, trustworthy.

256
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,326
The filtration system
is state of the art.

257
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:55,787
It will vent nothing
but clean, odourless steam...

258
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:57,748
...just as the laundry does...

259
00:24:57,956 --> 00:25:00,792
...and through the very same stacks.

260
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:07,674
I need 200 pounds per week
to make this economically viable.

261
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:11,261
You would choose your own hours,
of course...

262
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,555
...come and go as you please...

263
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:16,183
...so long as the quota is met.

264
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,622
Sorry.

265
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:41,667
The answer is still no.

266
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:52,302
I have made a series
of very bad decisions...

267
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:54,847
...and I cannot make another one.

268
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:56,932
Why did you make these decisions?

269
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:59,518
For the good of my family.

270
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:03,480
Then they weren't bad decisions.

271
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:08,777
What does a man do, Walter?

272
00:26:11,446 --> 00:26:14,658
A man provides for his family.

273
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:17,661
This cost me my family.

274
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:20,497
When you have children,
you always have family.

275
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:24,042
They will always be your priority,
your responsibility.

276
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:28,881
And a man... A man provides.

277
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,678
And he does it
even when he's not appreciated...

278
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:36,430
...or respected...

279
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:39,808
...or even loved.

280
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:44,646
He simply bears up, and he does it...

281
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:48,317
...because he's a man.

282
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:11,507
Any chance
we could grab a quick bite?

283
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:14,301
Thai place around the corner's
pretty good.

284
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:18,055
I really gotta head home.

285
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:21,266
All right, rain check, then.

286
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:44,456
She said it was the tofu.

287
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:50,796
Whatever. She's still cute anyways.

288
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:58,262
Great dinner, Mom.

289
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:05,978
Can I be... excused?

290
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:08,772
To do homework
or to play video games?

291
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:10,566
I can multitask.

292
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:13,944
Yeah.

293
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:04,870
You wanna take her?

294
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:15,672
Yeah.

295
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:18,652
Give me something, Andy. Come on.

296
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:29,746
Welded onto the back of a house.
Well, that's classy.

297
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:32,249
Christ.

298
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,170
Okay. Okay, thanks.

299
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:50,017
Hey, Janice. Janice.

300
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:54,563
That the last one?

301
00:30:55,898 --> 00:30:57,608
Sorry, Hank. That's all DMV had.

302
00:30:57,816 --> 00:31:01,778
Twenty nine... early '80s Bounders
registered in New Mexico.

303
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:05,908
- Could you check again?
- Now?

304
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:09,995
- Can I do it after the party?
- Janice, I'm...

305
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:11,622
I'm dead in the water here.

306
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:14,833
Okay, I'll check.

307
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:22,132
Hey, how are you guys doing?

308
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,723
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna clean it
really good, I tell you.

309
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:31,475
All good.

310
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:34,770
- Gomey.
- Yeah.

311
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:38,065
Time for the little bird to fly the nest,
huh?

312
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:42,861
The right guy for the job since
the bean-speak comes natural and all.

313
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:46,281
Wanna know how to say
"get bent" in Spanish?

314
00:31:46,782 --> 00:31:49,034
Just don't go native on me, all right?

315
00:31:53,664 --> 00:31:55,374
Hey.

316
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,252
Here.

317
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:02,506
Know your enemy and all.

318
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:14,893
- Fight the good fight, brother.
- I will.

319
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:19,106
Who got a drink around here?

320
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,160
Your hunch was right. One more RV.

321
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:34,538
DMV said the registration
wasn't renewed...

322
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:38,792
...but then they realised it was never
filed as non-operational or destroyed.

323
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:41,336
No police report, either.

324
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:11,093
I just don't know what the hell
I'm doing anymore, you know?

325
00:34:11,468 --> 00:34:14,012
It's like I'm paralyzed...

326
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:16,557
...like if I take a step
in any direction...

327
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:21,562
...I'm gonna make
a spectacular mistake.

328
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:26,525
God, I could go
for a glass of wine about now.

329
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:29,069
You wanna go to...?

330
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,696
Sorry, never mind.

331
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:35,492
Anyway...

332
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:40,205
...breaking news is
I am sleeping with my boss...

333
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:43,083
...and I don't know why.

334
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:45,586
Yep.

335
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:53,594
That's a lie. I do know why.

336
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:58,390
I mean, he's a lovely guy.

337
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:02,060
He's a really good person...

338
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:05,314
...but, I mean,
it's not like we're... ever gonna...

339
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:11,153
Somehow,
and I can't actually believe it...

340
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:16,366
...but my entire family
sees me as some sort of...

341
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:20,871
My own sister, my brother-in-law.

342
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:24,291
My teenage son...

343
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:26,627
...tells me I'm a bitch.

344
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:31,465
And you say tell him the truth.

345
00:35:32,758 --> 00:35:35,219
Tell him about his father...

346
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:38,138
...but I can't.

347
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:40,432
Ever.

348
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:42,851
How could I?

349
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,437
And this man that I'm seeing,
you know...

350
00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:47,856
...as wrong as I know it is...

351
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:51,235
...as much as I know I'm probably
doing it to make Walt leave me...

352
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:58,200
...it is the only thing in my day
where I don't feel...

353
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:02,829
...like I'm...

354
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,291
...drowning.

355
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:13,048
So he knows about this other man?

356
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,675
Yeah.

357
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:18,011
So then he'll sign?

358
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:23,350
Walt says he's not going anywhere...

359
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:27,980
...so that's a really brilliant
gambit on my part. Yep.

360
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:30,357
Genius.

361
00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:41,702
He keeps money in the house.

362
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:46,498
Your husband, the drug dealer?

363
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:48,750
How much money?

364
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:53,255
I didn't count it. It's heavy.

365
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:58,385
A bag, where he keeps it.

366
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:03,599
Are you asking my permission
to spend this money?

367
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:05,893
No. God, no. I just...

368
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:08,395
No, I'm just, you know...

369
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:12,024
I'm just trying to just talk it through.
That's...

370
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:14,359
Let me just say
that I'm half as qualified...

371
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:18,322
...and twice the price of a therapist.
There is nothing to discuss here.

372
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:22,492
I'm just saying, you know?
We have a history.

373
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:25,579
He's the father of my children...

374
00:37:26,038 --> 00:37:28,498
...and maybe what he did, he...

375
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:30,834
He did it for the family. Right?

376
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:33,045
Well, guess what.

377
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:35,839
That is one... enormous load
of horse shit.

378
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:37,341
Okay.

379
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:40,385
I'm going to spell this out
as simply as I can for you.

380
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:45,682
You are a fool to stay in that house
one minute longer.

381
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:48,185
If your husband won't leave,
then you go.

382
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:50,604
You are now an accessory
after the fact.

383
00:37:50,812 --> 00:37:52,022
You are culpable.

384
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:55,192
You, your children,
you could lose... everything you own.

385
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,319
Do you understand?

386
00:37:57,736 --> 00:38:02,491
All courtesy of this criminal
you refuse to divorce.

387
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:07,538
- I didn't marry a criminal.
- Well, you're married to one now.

388
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:29,411
How's about we run through this
one more time...

389
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,331
...especially where I do the talking,
you don't say jack?

390
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:35,501
Oh, I'm gonna say jack.
I'm gonna say plenty.

391
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:38,921
What did we say about escalating, huh?
Who's got your back here?

392
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:41,632
Me, all right?
I'm going to take care of things.

393
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,135
Hey, what are the parameters
of this sobriety thing you got going?

394
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:47,262
- What do you mean?
- Can you take a Xanax?

395
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:49,640
Because I got a drawer full of them.

396
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:53,018
I get them from my "chiropractor."

397
00:39:53,185 --> 00:39:58,065
Vietnamese, 5-foot tall.
She adjusts you to "completion."

398
00:39:59,149 --> 00:40:00,943
Her name's Kim Nu Suong...

399
00:40:02,194 --> 00:40:05,113
...as delicious as it sounds.

400
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:07,658
I should give you her card.

401
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:10,244
Hell with this. I'm out of here.

402
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,162
<i>He's here.</i>

403
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:15,624
Send him in.

404
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:22,923
Hello, Walt. Good to see you.

405
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:26,969
Please, have a seat here.

406
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:29,680
Mr. Pinkman, if you will.

407
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:33,100
You're late.

408
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:36,311
Gentlemen, if we could come
to some accommodation here now.

409
00:40:36,478 --> 00:40:38,981
There's always a way
to oil everyone's lock.

410
00:40:39,189 --> 00:40:43,068
This young man is prepared
to offer you a sweetheart of a deal...

411
00:40:43,235 --> 00:40:46,572
...for doing precisely nothing.
- Really?

412
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:51,493
Ten percent of all future profits
from his solo venture.

413
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:55,747
That's money you get paid
for walking down to the mailbox.

414
00:40:55,956 --> 00:40:59,543
Consider it a gesture of respect
for your valuable contribution...

415
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:03,547
...to the business thus far.
I'm sure you'll agree that's fair.

416
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:06,800
That's charity, is what that is.

417
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:08,510
I do all the work.

418
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:11,513
He sits around on his fat ass
judging people.

419
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:15,350
Escalating. Stop.

420
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:19,146
So there's that,
but then there's one small detail.

421
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:22,608
Clearly a mistake was made
on the part of our mutual associate...

422
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:25,360
...when he paid you half
of Jesse's earnings.

423
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:29,072
He must not have realised that you two
had come to a parting of the ways.

424
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:32,034
Take it. It belongs to you.

425
00:41:32,242 --> 00:41:34,369
You're damn right it belongs to me.

426
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:37,956
I knew I could count on you boys
to play nice. That's...

427
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:40,501
- That almost brings a tear to my eye.
- Enjoy it.

428
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:43,003
Spend it in good health.

429
00:41:43,337 --> 00:41:47,799
That is the last money
you'll ever earn in this business.

430
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:50,636
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

431
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:57,726
Well, I hate to break it to you, Jesse,
but our mutual associate...

432
00:41:57,935 --> 00:42:01,980
...was only using you to get to me.

433
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:03,482
What are you talking about?

434
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:08,070
See, he needs someone
with expertise...

435
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:10,989
...someone who knows
what he's doing.

436
00:42:11,198 --> 00:42:14,743
In other words, he needs me.

437
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,496
You're telling me
you're cooking again?

438
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:21,208
Yeah.
Let's see, how should I put this?

439
00:42:23,293 --> 00:42:24,503
I'm in.

440
00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:27,381
You're out.

441
00:42:30,968 --> 00:42:33,178
Walt, hold on there.

442
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:37,182
What was the offer, if I may ask?

443
00:42:37,683 --> 00:42:42,563
It's three million
for three months of my time.

444
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:45,774
You're gonna need that money
laundered. I mean, of course.

445
00:42:45,983 --> 00:42:47,276
What was our deal before?

446
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:49,570
Seventeen percent.
That's a shade high.

447
00:42:49,778 --> 00:42:53,073
Let's settle on an even 15.
That's a nice round number.

448
00:42:53,282 --> 00:42:54,283
Five percent.

449
00:42:54,491 --> 00:42:56,076
- Fourteen's fair.
- Five.

450
00:42:56,285 --> 00:42:57,286
- Thirteen.
- Five.

451
00:42:57,494 --> 00:43:00,539
- Twelve. For old times' sake, 12.
- Five.

452
00:43:00,747 --> 00:43:03,250
I'm a reasonable guy.
It's a short-term deal.

453
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:06,879
Ten even, but I can't go any lower
and still respect myself.

454
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:08,088
Five.

455
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:12,176
What in the hell just happened?
You're my lawyer, not his.

456
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:15,804
That's the way of the world, kid.
Go with the winner.

457
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:18,265
You think this will stop me
from cooking?

458
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:19,975
Cook whatever you like.

459
00:43:20,142 --> 00:43:24,104
As long as it's that ridiculous
Chilli P or some other dreck...

460
00:43:24,313 --> 00:43:27,482
...but don't even think
about using my formula.

461
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:30,819
Just try and stop me, bitch.

462
00:44:21,495 --> 00:44:23,914
- Yes?
- Hi there, Mrs. Ortega?

463
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:26,083
- Yes.
- Hi, I'm Hank Schrader.

464
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:29,002
I'm with the Drug Enforcement
Administration.

465
00:44:29,211 --> 00:44:32,673
We're interested in an RV that's
registered to your name and address.

466
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:36,635
- Do you have an RV?
- I did.

467
00:44:36,802 --> 00:44:38,637
It was stolen months ago.

468
00:44:39,555 --> 00:44:41,598
Stolen, huh? Yeah.

469
00:44:42,432 --> 00:44:45,644
Well, then I'm curious as to why
the theft was never reported.

470
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:48,730
I'm not seeing any records
of it with the police or the DMV.

471
00:44:48,939 --> 00:44:51,692
I just didn't get around to it.

472
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:53,777
May I ask why?

473
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:57,865
I mean, it's a great way
to get the family together...

474
00:44:58,073 --> 00:44:59,491
...for an affordable vacation.

475
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,743
It must've been a blow
when it went missing.

476
00:45:01,952 --> 00:45:03,537
It was.

477
00:45:05,122 --> 00:45:07,916
Do you have any ideas at all
who might've taken it?

478
00:45:10,419 --> 00:45:12,754
I didn't want him arrested.

479
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:17,384
He ran with a bad crowd,
but he was never a bad person.

480
00:45:18,135 --> 00:45:19,970
I thought he could turn
his life around.

481
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:21,930
Who are we talking about,
Mrs. Ortega?

482
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:24,224
My son.

483
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,436
I'd really like to speak with him.

484
00:45:28,395 --> 00:45:32,482
He's passed away.
He was shot two months ago.

485
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:36,486
- What was your son's name?
- Christian.

486
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:39,114
Christian Ortega.

487
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:43,410
Was his nickname Combo?

488
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:54,796
Thanks for this.
I really appreciate it.

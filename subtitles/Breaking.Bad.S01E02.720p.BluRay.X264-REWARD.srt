1
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,642
Are you okay?

2
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:57,833
- You are a life saver.
- Yeah, man.

3
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,543
- We can't thank you enough.
- Hey, mad props.

4
00:02:00,585 --> 00:02:02,760
I could have sworn
the guy said south.

5
00:02:02,795 --> 00:02:05,048
But then, all of a sudden
we're off the main road.

6
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:08,551
I'm trying to read the map while I'm
driving, which is a bonehead maneuver.

7
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,471
And all of a sudden...
Bam, we're in that ditch.

8
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:14,056
Yeah, bam,
I'm like, what the hell? You know?

9
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:16,016
Yes, and my coffee mug.

10
00:02:16,558 --> 00:02:18,192
Coffee? My mug of coffee?

11
00:02:18,227 --> 00:02:21,563
It spills all over my pants.
I mean, just... a nightmare.

12
00:02:21,897 --> 00:02:24,608
Dude, you so need GPS.
I mean, for real.

13
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:49,005
Like I said,

14
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:52,217
we couldn't be more grateful.

15
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,274
Can't we just
dump 'em here?

16
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:11,401
What, then somebody finds them?

17
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:14,279
Then what?
People have seen us.

18
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,953
You're gonna flood it, man.

19
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:25,455
I'm not gonna flood it.
She's not gonna flood, all right?

20
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,583
We're just gonna stay positive, right?

21
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,003
We're going to clean up this mess.
Wish you would start.

22
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,338
Damn it. See? You flooded it.

23
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,133
All right. All right.
You know what?

24
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,392
The RV is going to start now.

25
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,512
The RV is going
to start right now.

26
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,307
It's gonna start and we're gonna
drive it over to your house.

27
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:45,558
- My house?
- Yes.

28
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,976
We'll drive it over there
and park it overnight.

29
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:50,353
- And then tomorrow...
- No, man, not my house!

30
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:53,231
Shut up!

31
00:04:05,618 --> 00:04:08,329
After we finish
cleaning up this mess,

32
00:04:09,538 --> 00:04:11,540
we will go our separate ways.

33
00:04:11,582 --> 00:04:14,335
Our paths will never cross.

34
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,669
And we will tell this to no one.

35
00:04:16,878 --> 00:04:18,463
Understood?

36
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:23,051
What, I can talk now?

37
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:25,136
Fine.

38
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,972
That goes double for me.

39
00:04:34,645 --> 00:04:36,230
Be good to me.

40
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:13,138
Oh, shit.

41
00:05:14,598 --> 00:05:17,726
"The Cat's in the Bag"

42
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:42,775
Walt?

43
00:05:45,486 --> 00:05:47,196
You coming out?

44
00:05:56,037 --> 00:05:57,831
Yeah, absolutely.

45
00:06:11,427 --> 00:06:13,721
You wanna hear something funny?

46
00:06:14,638 --> 00:06:17,974
We had a faculty
meeting last Thursday

47
00:06:18,016 --> 00:06:21,311
and the topic was
senior class photos,

48
00:06:21,644 --> 00:06:24,689
and how we had instituted
a new rule last year

49
00:06:24,724 --> 00:06:26,614
that seniors are allowed to

50
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:29,986
have photos taken by
a photographer of their choice,

51
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,156
Not necessarily the photographer
that the school hires, right? So...

52
00:06:37,242 --> 00:06:40,204
Anyway, some of the senior girls

53
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,372
were going to that...

54
00:06:42,414 --> 00:06:45,750
Glamour Shots place,
to have their photos taken,

55
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:49,087
and now they're bringing us
all these photos,

56
00:06:49,337 --> 00:06:51,137
and Joan Epperman,
you know Joan,

57
00:06:51,172 --> 00:06:54,112
suddenly has to go
through all these photos

58
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,053
and turn them down,
because they show cleavage.

59
00:07:00,931 --> 00:07:03,350
Did you get enough
pancakes, sweetie?

60
00:07:03,517 --> 00:07:05,477
Yeah. I'm good.

61
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:10,565
You know, even these
small-busted girls... have cleavage.

62
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:15,194
Apparently there's some
new type of brassiere,

63
00:07:15,778 --> 00:07:17,738
or something.

64
00:07:18,114 --> 00:07:19,990
The Wonderbra...

65
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,993
It's the Wonderbra.

66
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:34,295
Hey, there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter, Junior.

67
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:38,007
We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave us a message.

68
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:41,635
Hello, Mr. White.
This is AT&T calling.

69
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:44,847
Are you happy with your
current long distance service?

70
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,620
'Cause if you're not,
I would definitely, really

71
00:07:47,655 --> 00:07:50,129
love to talk to you
as soon as possible about...

72
00:07:50,164 --> 00:07:52,604
Hello? Hello.
This is Walter White speaking.

73
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:55,231
You said he was
practically dead, okay?

74
00:07:55,273 --> 00:07:57,240
You said he would die any minute!

75
00:07:57,275 --> 00:08:00,653
Listen, I am having breakfast
with my family right now,

76
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,614
and I really don't appreciate
these sales calls.

77
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,200
Well, too bad, man,
'cause guess what.

78
00:08:06,242 --> 00:08:07,791
He's still not dead!

79
00:08:07,826 --> 00:08:10,746
I went and put my ear to the RV,
I can hear him, like,

80
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:12,789
rolling around in there, all right?

81
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:16,543
I think he's awake, man,
I think he's trying to get loose.

82
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:19,010
Where the hell are you?
I'm freaking out over here!

83
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:21,839
- Calm down, damn it.
- Are you gonna help me clean this up?

84
00:08:21,922 --> 00:08:24,925
- We got loose ends here!
- Calm down!

85
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:26,559
I will be there after school.

86
00:08:26,594 --> 00:08:29,180
After school?
Are you shitting me?

87
00:08:29,263 --> 00:08:31,348
Ditch it, man, call in sick.

88
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,018
Listen, that is just not
going to work for me.

89
00:08:34,053 --> 00:08:35,817
I'm not interested in that at all.

90
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:39,314
And I would appreciate
if you don't call here anymore.

91
00:08:39,647 --> 00:08:42,192
Damn. They're so annoying,
those people.

92
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:49,737
- You have a good day, sweetie.
- Okay, Mom. You too.

93
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,781
Bye, honey.

94
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,580
- Drive safe.
- Okay.

95
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:14,135
Yo, yo, yo, 148-3369,

96
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,929
representing the ABQ.

97
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:18,556
What up, biatch?

98
00:09:18,598 --> 00:09:20,516
Leave it at the tone.

99
00:09:34,856 --> 00:09:38,401
So, the term "chiral"

100
00:09:39,027 --> 00:09:42,322
derives from
the Greek word "hand."

101
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,409
The concept here being that,
just as your left hand,

102
00:09:47,868 --> 00:09:51,956
and your right hand are
mirror images of one another, right?

103
00:09:52,206 --> 00:09:54,250
Identical, and yet opposite.

104
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:58,211
Well, so too organic
compounds can exist as

105
00:09:58,246 --> 00:10:00,338
mirror image forms

106
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:03,550
of one another all the way down
at the molecular level.

107
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:07,428
But although
they may look the same,

108
00:10:07,613 --> 00:10:09,906
they don't always
behave the same.

109
00:10:10,031 --> 00:10:11,574
For instance...

110
00:10:18,373 --> 00:10:21,125
I'm sorry...
For instance...

111
00:10:21,584 --> 00:10:23,418
Thalidomide.

112
00:10:24,336 --> 00:10:28,388
The right-handed isomer
of the drug Thalidomide

113
00:10:28,423 --> 00:10:32,427
is a perfectly fine good medicine
to give to a pregnant woman

114
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:35,222
to prevent morning sickness but,

115
00:10:35,347 --> 00:10:38,265
make the mistake of giving
that same pregnant woman

116
00:10:38,307 --> 00:10:41,433
the left-handed isomer
of the drug Thalidomide,

117
00:10:41,468 --> 00:10:44,228
and her child
will be born with

118
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,396
horrible birth defects.

119
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,651
Which is precisely
what happened in the 1950s.

120
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:55,988
So, chiral, chirality,

121
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,449
mirrored images, right?

122
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,952
Active, inactive.

123
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,745
Good, bad.

124
00:11:07,371 --> 00:11:08,706
Yes, Ben?

125
00:11:08,956 --> 00:11:11,208
Is this gonna be on the murder?

126
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:14,461
What?

127
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,089
Is this gonna be on the mid-term?

128
00:11:20,758 --> 00:11:23,761
The chirality on the mid-term?
No, no, well, maybe,

129
00:11:23,886 --> 00:11:26,431
maybe, yes, you know,
but prepare

130
00:11:26,514 --> 00:11:28,641
for it to be on the mid-term.

131
00:11:28,676 --> 00:11:30,768
Can't hurt to know it, right?

132
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:32,853
Knowledge is power!

133
00:12:48,275 --> 00:12:50,026
Oh, no, no...

134
00:12:58,951 --> 00:13:01,078
Not good. Not good.

135
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:20,143
What the...

136
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:42,714
Hey, you.

137
00:13:45,021 --> 00:13:47,106
Listen...
No, no, no, no!

138
00:13:51,816 --> 00:13:53,067
Oh, God!

139
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:58,769
MILF's?

140
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,022
What the hell is a MILF?

141
00:15:20,873 --> 00:15:22,333
Now what?

142
00:15:27,003 --> 00:15:29,756
The other one,
out in the RV, he's...

143
00:15:31,007 --> 00:15:32,592
- You're sure?
- Yes.

144
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:33,510
Positive?

145
00:15:33,551 --> 00:15:36,179
- Feel free to go check it yourself.
- Yes, good idea.

146
00:15:36,221 --> 00:15:39,306
Maybe I should do that before he, too,
wanders off on the damn street!

147
00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:42,142
- Okay, you know what, I...
- All right, all right!

148
00:15:43,686 --> 00:15:46,230
The one downstairs,
tell me about him.

149
00:15:46,981 --> 00:15:48,691
Come on, anything, something!

150
00:15:48,732 --> 00:15:51,609
- Start with his name, at least!
- Krazy-8.

151
00:15:51,859 --> 00:15:54,278
Krazy-8?
What the hell does that even mean?

152
00:15:54,362 --> 00:15:57,073
I don't know, man, okay?
I mean, he's like,

153
00:15:57,115 --> 00:15:59,283
Krazy-8, okay? I don't know.

154
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:02,245
So, you work with him regularly?

155
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,496
No, not him so much.

156
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:07,249
- His cousin, mainly.
- Who's his cousin?

157
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:10,293
- The guy out in the RV!
- All right, all right.

158
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,713
Krazy-8's one level higher.

159
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:14,715
One level higher?

160
00:16:14,798 --> 00:16:16,800
Yeah, you know,
not like street level.

161
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,300
Higher.

162
00:16:18,592 --> 00:16:21,554
You know, there's like
a Starbucks at every corner?

163
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,182
Krazy-8 is, like, the dude
that sells Starbucks his beans.

164
00:16:25,474 --> 00:16:27,643
Okay, so he's a distributor.

165
00:16:28,894 --> 00:16:30,771
Okay, so, is he...

166
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:34,232
I mean, is he...
In other words...

167
00:16:34,267 --> 00:16:37,277
What is his reputation for violence?

168
00:16:38,111 --> 00:16:39,863
Well, um...

169
00:16:39,946 --> 00:16:43,261
He did try to kill us both
yesterday, so there's that.

170
00:16:43,296 --> 00:16:46,646
What I'm trying to say
is that he's a distributor, right?

171
00:16:46,681 --> 00:16:49,997
He's a... He's a businessman,
he's a man of business.

172
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:53,375
It would therefore seem to follow
that he is capable of acting

173
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:56,086
out of mutual self-interest, yes?

174
00:16:57,046 --> 00:16:57,963
What?

175
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,840
Do you think he is capable

176
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:03,384
of listening to reason?

177
00:17:04,052 --> 00:17:05,393
What kind of reason?

178
00:17:05,428 --> 00:17:07,186
Like "Dear Krazy-8, listen,

179
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:10,475
"if I let you go, will you promise not
to come back and waste my family?

180
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,310
"No Colombian neckties."
You mean that kind of reason?

181
00:17:13,435 --> 00:17:17,356
No, man, I can't say as I have
high hopes where that's concerned.

182
00:17:23,403 --> 00:17:24,821
What was that?

183
00:17:25,989 --> 00:17:27,573
What was what?

184
00:17:32,161 --> 00:17:33,621
Come see!

185
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,582
We gotta tie him up.

186
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,126
Why the hell didn't we tie him up?

187
00:17:39,418 --> 00:17:41,378
Because he was out cold.

188
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:43,338
But what if he's faking it?

189
00:17:43,505 --> 00:17:47,217
Like if it was me, I'd be all
faking being knocked out, yo!

190
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:50,011
And then,
when the coast is clear,

191
00:17:50,095 --> 00:17:52,555
I'd be up looking
for weapons and shit,

192
00:17:52,597 --> 00:17:54,264
waiting to pounce!

193
00:18:19,247 --> 00:18:23,041
Now if it was me, and I couldn't
find a decent enough weapon,

194
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:26,378
I would just lie back down,
and bide my time.

195
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,009
So now what do we do?

196
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:29,430
You keep asking me that

197
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:33,017
like you think
I have some answer.

198
00:19:34,602 --> 00:19:37,104
- Well, you gotta do something!
- We!

199
00:19:37,271 --> 00:19:40,566
We have got to do something,
and I am opened to suggestions.

200
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:43,443
Man, uh-uh, okay,
this whole thing was your deal!

201
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:45,737
Don't you dare put that on me!

202
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,157
You brought those guys out there,
this is your responsability!

203
00:19:49,366 --> 00:19:50,804
Like I came to you,
begging to cook meth.

204
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:55,531
"Nerdiest old dude I know,
you wanna come cook crystal?" Please!

205
00:19:55,532 --> 00:19:59,618
"I'd ask my diaper-wearing granny, but
her wheelchair wouldn't fit in the RV."

206
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:09,961
What about the...
the phosphate gas?

207
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:12,672
Phosphine gas.
What about it?

208
00:20:12,755 --> 00:20:15,716
I mean, do you think
it still might kill him?

209
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:18,553
You know, with like
a delayed reaction or something?

210
00:20:20,472 --> 00:20:21,521
I don't know.

211
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:24,475
- You're supposed to be a scientist!
- Look!

212
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:28,396
This isn't even the issue
that demands immediate attention.

213
00:20:29,063 --> 00:20:31,774
We have got a body in that RV,

214
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:34,485
and it's getting warmer
outside, understand?

215
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,862
And we have got to do something
about that soon.

216
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,782
And in a way that
no one will ever find it.

217
00:20:40,817 --> 00:20:43,118
Now that last part

218
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,177
is very, very important.

219
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:46,429
Therefore,

220
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:51,933
it seems to me that
our best course of action

221
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,437
would be chemical disincorporation.

222
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:02,193
Dissolving in strong acid.

223
00:21:09,658 --> 00:21:11,994
Oh man, that's messed up.

224
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:16,290
You're not...
You're not serious?

225
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:19,199
You're serious?

226
00:21:26,427 --> 00:21:28,429
Who's gonna do that?

227
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:30,556
And don't look at me!

228
00:21:33,183 --> 00:21:35,317
I guess we'll both do it together.

229
00:21:35,352 --> 00:21:38,689
No, Mr. White, okay,
I'm not good with dead bodies.

230
00:21:39,606 --> 00:21:43,610
We're in this 50/50, okay?

231
00:21:46,268 --> 00:21:49,125
I guess the only
other fair way

232
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,982
to go about this would be...

233
00:21:52,191 --> 00:21:55,486
that one of us deals with the...

234
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,530
body situation,
while the other one of us...

235
00:21:59,906 --> 00:22:03,368
deals with the Krazy-8 situation.

236
00:22:09,932 --> 00:22:11,440
In a scenario like this,

237
00:22:11,475 --> 00:22:14,978
I don't suppose
it is bad form to just...

238
00:22:16,521 --> 00:22:18,190
flip a coin.

239
00:22:26,447 --> 00:22:29,992
- Heads or tails?
- I'll do the body in the acid, okay?

240
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:32,578
Heads or tails?

241
00:22:41,878 --> 00:22:42,879
Heads.

242
00:23:03,106 --> 00:23:05,025
Best two out of three?

243
00:23:21,414 --> 00:23:25,126
Yo, yo, yo, 148-3369,

244
00:23:25,168 --> 00:23:26,920
representing the ABQ.

245
00:23:26,962 --> 00:23:28,470
What up, biatch?

246
00:23:28,505 --> 00:23:30,382
Leave it at the tone.

247
00:23:31,508 --> 00:23:33,468
Mr. White, it's me, pick up.

248
00:23:34,593 --> 00:23:36,762
I got a container question.

249
00:23:38,347 --> 00:23:41,267
Hello? Mr. White,
pick up the phone, man!

250
00:23:41,475 --> 00:23:42,268
Yes?

251
00:23:42,351 --> 00:23:44,103
What kind of plastic, man?

252
00:23:44,144 --> 00:23:46,105
Polyethylene.

253
00:23:47,465 --> 00:23:49,216
How the hell
am I supposed to know that?

254
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:51,010
Because I told you.

255
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:52,845
Look, just...

256
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:57,558
look at the bottom
for a triangle

257
00:23:58,058 --> 00:24:00,311
stamped "LDPE."

258
00:24:00,352 --> 00:24:02,645
It should be molded
right into the plastic.

259
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:05,106
Yeah, yeah, LDPE.
Right on, got it.

260
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:09,569
But... I don't know, man,
this feels kind of flimsy.

261
00:24:10,153 --> 00:24:12,905
Any decent acid's gonna
eat right through this.

262
00:24:13,031 --> 00:24:15,532
- Not hydrofluoric.
- Why not?

263
00:24:17,576 --> 00:24:20,704
Look, you skipped,

264
00:24:21,204 --> 00:24:23,415
clowned around
or otherwise jerked off

265
00:24:23,457 --> 00:24:25,959
to every lecture I ever gave.

266
00:24:26,084 --> 00:24:29,629
As far as I'm concerned,
your chemistry education is over.

267
00:24:29,795 --> 00:24:31,964
Oh, okay.
Be a dick about it.

268
00:24:34,884 --> 00:24:36,552
So, hey, have you...

269
00:24:38,095 --> 00:24:40,181
Have you done the thing?

270
00:24:45,488 --> 00:24:49,158
Yeah, I'm working up to it.

271
00:24:52,704 --> 00:24:55,874
You know what?
I bet he doesn't even wake up.

272
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:59,665
Not even if you took him
to the hospital right now.

273
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:04,170
Now, if it was me, I would just
try and think of it like I was...

274
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:07,131
I was doing him a favor.

275
00:27:18,844 --> 00:27:20,345
Who's there?

276
00:27:24,062 --> 00:27:26,647
Don't you fucking play games
with me. Who's there?

277
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:33,445
Yeah, I see you.

278
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:38,784
What are you gonna do?

279
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,880
I need water!

280
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:59,476
Bring me some water, would you?

281
00:28:01,895 --> 00:28:03,147
Please?

282
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:21,427
You don't like the crust?

283
00:29:31,648 --> 00:29:33,692
Where's my cousin Emilio?

284
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,573
He dead?

285
00:31:33,652 --> 00:31:35,321
Hey, Mr. White!

286
00:31:36,405 --> 00:31:37,865
Mr. White?

287
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,247
Are you smoking weed?

288
00:31:46,282 --> 00:31:47,832
Oh, my God!

289
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:50,869
Wait a minute.
Is that my weed?

290
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:54,498
What the hell, man?

291
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:57,417
Make yourself at home,
why don't you?

292
00:31:59,455 --> 00:32:01,624
So what did you end up buying?

293
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:03,626
Nothing.

294
00:32:05,127 --> 00:32:08,881
No store in town sells a plastic bin
big enough for a body.

295
00:32:10,674 --> 00:32:13,801
I don't suppose you could
buy two bins...

296
00:32:18,973 --> 00:32:21,684
Legs in one,
torso in the other?

297
00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:23,603
God.

298
00:32:25,104 --> 00:32:27,731
I don't suppose
you could kiss my ass?

299
00:32:39,526 --> 00:32:41,652
How did it go?

300
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,475
So you didn't do it?

301
00:32:51,288 --> 00:32:52,623
Not yet.

302
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:54,846
God.

303
00:32:59,443 --> 00:33:02,696
- I gotta go.
- What? No, come back here!

304
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:06,075
Sorry.
I'll do it tomorrow, I promise.

305
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:06,988
Tomorrow?

306
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,197
I've got a doctor's appointement,
I gotta go.

307
00:33:09,386 --> 00:33:11,305
Look, stay away from him.

308
00:33:11,743 --> 00:33:13,078
He's awake.

309
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:17,789
Hey, man, we flipped a coin.

310
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:21,924
We flipped a coin!

311
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:30,023
We're good?

312
00:33:30,627 --> 00:33:32,379
We're very good.

313
00:33:32,431 --> 00:33:34,391
We're excellent, I'd say.

314
00:33:37,612 --> 00:33:41,366
Oh, would you look at that face!

315
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:43,648
Smile, peanut!

316
00:33:46,957 --> 00:33:48,958
So, who's up for knowing?

317
00:33:57,747 --> 00:33:58,863
Girl.

318
00:33:58,898 --> 00:33:59,979
Girl?

319
00:34:00,882 --> 00:34:02,925
- You sure?
- Pretty sure.

320
00:34:08,224 --> 00:34:11,310
Can I tell you this is exactly
what I was hoping?

321
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:16,462
You remember you said that
when she's 16 and starts dating.

322
00:34:17,065 --> 00:34:18,775
Looking fabulous.

323
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:21,710
Let me see if they're done with the
blood sugar, then we'll get you out.

324
00:34:22,257 --> 00:34:23,884
I'll be right back.

325
00:34:51,229 --> 00:34:53,023
Who is Jesse Pinkman?

326
00:35:00,654 --> 00:35:01,781
Jesse...

327
00:35:02,705 --> 00:35:04,123
Jesse Pinkman.

328
00:35:06,865 --> 00:35:10,576
He called just this morning,
Walt, please don't deny it.

329
00:35:11,351 --> 00:35:15,396
It says on his MyShout page
he attended Wynne.

330
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,909
Was he one of your students?

331
00:35:17,944 --> 00:35:19,734
Yeah. He was...

332
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:21,810
nobody.

333
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,373
Who is he to you?

334
00:35:26,398 --> 00:35:28,069
Why is he calling?
What is this big secret

335
00:35:28,104 --> 00:35:31,858
you seem to be discussing
with some... druggie burn-out?

336
00:35:34,753 --> 00:35:37,428
You don't come home

337
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:40,824
last night until 2 in the morning,
you don't tell me where you've been.

338
00:35:40,945 --> 00:35:44,490
You spent the entire night
in the bathroom, Walt.

339
00:35:45,128 --> 00:35:47,839
Tell me what's going on with you.

340
00:35:48,136 --> 00:35:50,305
Don't you think you owe me that?

341
00:35:54,347 --> 00:35:56,808
Who's this Jesse Pinkman to you?

342
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,912
He sells me pot.

343
00:36:06,814 --> 00:36:09,609
He sells you... pot?

344
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:11,876
Marijuana, yeah.

345
00:36:12,189 --> 00:36:13,607
Not a lot.

346
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:15,894
I mean, I don't know.

347
00:36:17,924 --> 00:36:19,675
I kinda like it.

348
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,939
Are you out of your mind?

349
00:36:23,862 --> 00:36:26,123
What are you,
like 16 years old?

350
00:36:26,158 --> 00:36:28,385
Your brother-in-law is a DEA agent.

351
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,410
What is wrong with you?

352
00:36:32,947 --> 00:36:34,199
Skyler...

353
00:36:38,261 --> 00:36:39,763
I just...

354
00:36:40,649 --> 00:36:43,401
haven't quite been myself lately.

355
00:36:44,058 --> 00:36:45,898
Yeah, no shit.
Thanks for noticing.

356
00:36:45,933 --> 00:36:50,062
I haven't been myself
lately, but I love you.

357
00:36:50,881 --> 00:36:53,342
Nothing about that has changed.

358
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,621
Nothing ever will.

359
00:36:56,312 --> 00:36:59,397
So right now,
what I need

360
00:36:59,682 --> 00:37:03,353
is for you to climb down
out of my ass.

361
00:37:06,881 --> 00:37:08,633
Can you do that?

362
00:37:09,263 --> 00:37:11,181
Will you do that for me, honey?

363
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,940
Will you, please, just once,

364
00:37:15,253 --> 00:37:17,130
get off my ass?

365
00:37:17,249 --> 00:37:20,293
You know, I'd appreciate it.

366
00:37:21,366 --> 00:37:22,826
I really would.

367
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:45,355
Stop!

368
00:37:56,587 --> 00:37:59,173
Stop in 15 minutes.

369
00:38:50,145 --> 00:38:53,148
Just meat, is all.
Just a bunch of meat.

370
00:38:59,449 --> 00:39:00,909
Oh, Jesus.

371
00:39:05,674 --> 00:39:07,370
It's cool, you're cool.

372
00:39:07,405 --> 00:39:09,067
You're all good, yo.

373
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:12,195
You're all good in the hood.

374
00:39:12,312 --> 00:39:16,398
It's fine. Just a bunch of meat,
come on. You got it.

375
00:39:39,471 --> 00:39:40,639
Excuse me!

376
00:39:41,934 --> 00:39:43,142
Excuse me?

377
00:39:43,177 --> 00:39:43,905
You.

378
00:39:44,486 --> 00:39:45,658
Yes, you.

379
00:39:45,693 --> 00:39:47,403
May I talk to you?

380
00:39:51,261 --> 00:39:52,637
This is private property!

381
00:39:52,913 --> 00:39:54,831
Just a minute.
I wanna talk to you.

382
00:39:54,866 --> 00:39:55,785
No, I'm not interested.

383
00:39:55,786 --> 00:39:59,604
Hey, don't touch me!
Do not touch me.

384
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:02,433
All right, look, not touching, okay?
Not touching here.

385
00:40:03,308 --> 00:40:06,270
Look, lady, whatever you're selling,
I ain't buying, yo.

386
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:08,643
Well, my name is Skyler White, yo.

387
00:40:08,678 --> 00:40:10,997
My husband is Walter White, yo.

388
00:40:13,086 --> 00:40:14,921
He told me everything.

389
00:40:15,662 --> 00:40:17,914
- Seriously?
- That's right.

390
00:40:18,596 --> 00:40:20,473
And just so you know...

391
00:40:20,905 --> 00:40:24,408
My brother-in-law is a DEA agent.

392
00:40:24,926 --> 00:40:27,262
And I will not hesitate to call him.

393
00:40:27,317 --> 00:40:29,111
Not if I have to.

394
00:40:29,484 --> 00:40:30,693
Understood?

395
00:40:31,648 --> 00:40:34,401
This is your one
and only warning.

396
00:40:34,837 --> 00:40:38,715
Do not sell marijuana
to my husband.

397
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,345
- Okay.
- I mean it.

398
00:40:43,522 --> 00:40:45,649
Don't call our house again.

399
00:40:45,741 --> 00:40:49,536
You stay away from him,
or you'll be one sorry individual.

400
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:52,787
You got me?

401
00:40:54,006 --> 00:40:55,549
I think so, yeah.

402
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,617
No more marijuana.

403
00:40:58,177 --> 00:40:59,595
I can dig it.

404
00:41:00,076 --> 00:41:01,619
You can dig it.

405
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,136
Wonderful.

406
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,616
Not that it's any of my business,

407
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:19,837
but you might wanna consider
a different line of work.

408
00:41:19,888 --> 00:41:21,097
Okay.

409
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:19,663
"Let's go to your house, yo!

410
00:42:20,113 --> 00:42:22,657
"Makes perfect sense. Let's...

411
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:26,329
"Let's completely
screw up your house

412
00:42:26,614 --> 00:42:28,950
"so you never wanna
spend another night in it."

413
00:42:28,989 --> 00:42:31,367
"Sure.
You know, why not?"

414
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:40,310
"And then, how's about I send over
my psycho-bitch wife to...

415
00:42:40,636 --> 00:42:42,846
"you know, break your balls
and threaten you?

416
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:45,155
"God, that'd be hilarious."

417
00:42:45,432 --> 00:42:47,452
"And then, the killer
in the basement?

418
00:42:47,487 --> 00:42:50,949
"The one who's completely
my responsabilty.

419
00:42:50,995 --> 00:42:54,415
"Hell, let's just let him
live down there.

420
00:42:55,437 --> 00:42:59,316
"Just, I don't know,
make sure to feed him, like...

421
00:42:59,351 --> 00:43:00,427
"three times a day."

422
00:43:01,397 --> 00:43:02,898
"Sure, why not?

423
00:43:03,475 --> 00:43:04,847
"That would be amazing.

424
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:06,967
"Thank you so much
for the opportunity.

425
00:43:07,286 --> 00:43:10,789
"I always dreamt about,
I don't know, melting bodies."

426
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:37,323
You got a brother
in the goddamned DEA?

427
00:43:40,778 --> 00:43:41,571
What?

428
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,052
You said you were just
doing some ride-along.

429
00:43:44,087 --> 00:43:46,345
Yes or no, do you have
a brother in the DEA?

430
00:43:47,903 --> 00:43:49,403
Brother-in-law.

431
00:43:49,982 --> 00:43:51,943
Now there's a load off my mind.

432
00:43:51,978 --> 00:43:53,661
Where did you hear that?

433
00:43:53,804 --> 00:43:57,600
Your freaking wife told me
when she was here all up on my shit.

434
00:43:57,665 --> 00:43:59,000
Yeah, that's right.

435
00:43:59,192 --> 00:44:01,694
She almost caught me
moving Emilio!

436
00:44:02,449 --> 00:44:05,243
Good job in wearing
the pants in the family.

437
00:44:05,325 --> 00:44:08,871
And why did you go and tell her
I was selling you weed?

438
00:44:09,531 --> 00:44:13,076
Because somehow,
it seemed preferable to admitting

439
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:16,236
that I cook crystal meth
and killed a man.

440
00:44:25,074 --> 00:44:26,784
Is that what I think it is?

441
00:44:27,681 --> 00:44:30,140
Yeah, it is.
I smoked a bowl, so what?

442
00:44:30,175 --> 00:44:31,776
My house, my rules.

443
00:44:32,082 --> 00:44:35,585
Hey, no, no! Don't give me that, okay?
I held up my end.

444
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:36,405
I already took care of Emilio.

445
00:44:36,879 --> 00:44:39,381
You're still diddling around,
trying to get your nut up.

446
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:43,234
Well, boo-hoo.
I have the truly awful job here.

447
00:44:43,269 --> 00:44:45,135
You wanna talk awful?
You wanna go there?

448
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:49,258
Try dragging 200 pounds
of stink up a flight of stairs.

449
00:44:49,293 --> 00:44:51,518
I barely got him in the bathtub!

450
00:44:51,938 --> 00:44:53,482
Bathtub? What...

451
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,816
- What do you mean, "bathtub"?
- That's another thing,

452
00:44:56,851 --> 00:44:58,105
Why you got me
running around town,

453
00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:00,930
trying to find some
stupid piece of plastic,

454
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:03,282
when I have a perfectly
good tub I can use?

455
00:45:06,589 --> 00:45:08,007
Oh, God.

456
00:46:06,453 --> 00:46:08,497
I'm sorry,
what were you asking me?

457
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,875
Oh, yes.

458
00:46:10,591 --> 00:46:14,094
That stupid plastic container
I asked you to buy.

459
00:46:14,383 --> 00:46:17,928
You see, hydrofluoric acid
won't eat through plastic.

460
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:21,711
It will however dissolve
metal, rock,

461
00:46:21,746 --> 00:46:23,982
glass, ceramic.

462
00:46:25,031 --> 00:46:26,700
So there's that.

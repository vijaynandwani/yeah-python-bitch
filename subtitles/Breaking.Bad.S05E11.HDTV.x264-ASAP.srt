<i>Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...</i>

2
00:00:04,186 --> 00:00:05,483
Have Skyler bring
the kids here.

3
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:07,564
That is not going to happen.

4
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:09,788
I don't even know
who I'm talking to.

5
00:00:10,382 --> 00:00:11,842
Tread lightly.

6
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:13,873
Hank, are you arresting me?

7
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,156
Am I under arrest!?

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,000
Okay boys, take it all,
let's get everything.

9
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:25,874
<i>Do you know about
that money thing?</i>

10
00:00:25,997 --> 00:00:28,176
Involves your old
pal Jesse Pinkman.

11
00:00:51,459 --> 00:00:53,293
Hey, Mr. White.
It's me.

12
00:00:53,328 --> 00:00:58,765
Um, I know you're probably
real busy with retirement,

13
00:00:58,799 --> 00:00:59,866
but I just--
I got some news

14
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,568
I think that you
should maybe know about.

15
00:01:01,602 --> 00:01:03,703
Me and Declan had some
differences of opinion,

16
00:01:03,737 --> 00:01:05,805
and it got a little...

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,673
messy.

18
00:01:07,707 --> 00:01:11,610
Um, any-- It's all
straightened out now,

19
00:01:11,644 --> 00:01:14,813
but just a heads-up there's been
a kind of change in management.

20
00:01:14,848 --> 00:01:17,283
Anyway, um,
just thought you should know.

21
00:01:17,317 --> 00:01:19,251
Feel free to give me a call
if you want the details,

22
00:01:19,286 --> 00:01:20,886
but, you know, it's cool.

23
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,253
So whatever.

24
00:01:22,288 --> 00:01:25,423
Okay then. Thanks. Bye.

25
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:28,259
Right, so there I am,
I'm on top of the train,

26
00:01:28,294 --> 00:01:29,361
pumping the water in,

27
00:01:29,395 --> 00:01:30,795
and he's watching
to make sure we put in

28
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:33,331
exactly what he calculated.

29
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:34,466
And we gotta be real precise,

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,934
because water and methylene
weigh different,

31
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:38,435
and he, like,
figured it all out

32
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,536
to the, like, milliliter.

33
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,904
Anyway,
I'm up there with my hose,

34
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:42,606
and we're going
as fast as we can.

35
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,673
'Cause we only got
a few minutes.

36
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,142
At the crossing,
we got this guy

37
00:01:45,176 --> 00:01:47,244
who's smooth-talking
the engineer.

38
00:01:47,278 --> 00:01:48,979
And it's all just going great,

39
00:01:49,014 --> 00:01:52,849
until this other dude shows up
in this monster truck,

40
00:01:52,884 --> 00:01:54,050
so we're pretty much screwed,

41
00:01:54,084 --> 00:01:55,318
because he can just push

42
00:01:55,352 --> 00:01:56,785
the entire dump truck
off the tracks,

43
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,155
which, you know,
is what he does.

44
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:00,656
Wait.
What's your guy doing?

45
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,790
You can't stop him?

46
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:03,592
Yeah. But what's
he gonna say?

47
00:02:03,627 --> 00:02:08,131
"Thanks anyway, sir, but my friends
are still stealing cargo back there"?

48
00:02:08,165 --> 00:02:09,598
Anyway,
so I'm looking all around,

49
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:10,765
'cause I know we're not done,

50
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:13,068
but the gallons are just
slowly ticking away.

51
00:02:13,102 --> 00:02:15,037
And finally Mr. White
tells me to cut it.

52
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:17,272
And so I fling the hose,
I'm grabbing the cap,

53
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:18,306
I'm screwing in the bolts.

54
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:20,575
Just, like, busting ass,
you know?

55
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:25,447
And, um, and then I feel
the train start moving.

56
00:02:26,515 --> 00:02:27,515
- You're--
- I'm on top.

57
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:29,150
Did you piss your pants?

58
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:30,617
Yeah, right?

59
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:32,053
So the thing
starts speeding up,

60
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:35,089
so I jump off the moving train.

61
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:36,557
Like, total stuntman stuff.

62
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:37,591
It's like <i>Hooper.</i>

63
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,060
You ever see <i>Hooper?</i>

64
00:02:39,094 --> 00:02:41,295
Oh, hey, man, Burt Reynolds.
Good movie.

65
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:42,862
But he jumped out of
a helicopter, not a train.

66
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,630
Well, whatever, man.
It's a good movie.

67
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,066
And this guy Jesse,
he's underneath the thing,

68
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,168
and the train
just drives right over him.

69
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:50,970
And luckily he's--
he's this skinny little guy.

70
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,207
Damn.
That's a tight operation.

71
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:57,343
It was-- it was perfect.

72
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,144
No one even knew
they got robbed,

73
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,180
just like we planned.

74
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:05,117
Mr. White told me it was, like,
the biggest train heist ever,

75
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,119
like, potential money-wise.

76
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,455
So that's how that happened.

77
00:03:17,963 --> 00:03:20,465
Can I get you anything else?

78
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:22,400
Nope. Thanks, darlin'.

79
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:24,535
I'm ready for the check.

80
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:42,119
You feeling good about cooking?

81
00:03:42,153 --> 00:03:43,719
Yeah.

82
00:03:45,356 --> 00:03:48,324
You'll be able
to run your own lab?

83
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:49,358
Do it up right?

84
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:52,027
Yeah. For sure.
I got this.

85
00:03:54,697 --> 00:03:56,398
All right.

86
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:58,886
Let's make some money, then.

87
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:01,537
I gotta hit the head.

88
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:08,243
Ever been on a plane
and find yourself

89
00:04:08,277 --> 00:04:10,778
looking down at
the armrest next to you,

90
00:04:10,812 --> 00:04:15,016
looking at the little plug
where the ashtray used to go?

91
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,718
I look at that and I say,
"What the hell happened to this country?"

92
00:04:18,753 --> 00:04:20,254
Nanny state.

93
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:22,289
I see a kid with
a bicycle helmet on,

94
00:04:22,323 --> 00:04:24,090
I wanna smack the shit
out of him.

95
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,125
Like, for his own good.

96
00:05:11,818 --> 00:05:13,951

Mr. Pinkman.

99
00:06:10,934 --> 00:06:13,342
How are you today?

100
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:16,705
Not so good, huh?

101
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,544
'Course, uh, I might
be able to help you out.

102
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:26,681
I wanna talk to you about
your partner, Heisenberg.

103
00:06:26,715 --> 00:06:31,452
See, I know he's
my brother-in-law, Walt.

104
00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:35,033
Oh, yeah.
That's the look.

105
00:06:37,293 --> 00:06:42,125
Lucky for you,
I'm more interested in him.

106
00:06:42,898 --> 00:06:44,957
So I got an offer.

107
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:47,722
If you help me out here,

108
00:06:49,637 --> 00:06:54,467
tell me all about you and him
and your little meth business,

109
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,710
maybe I talk to my friends
at the APD

110
00:06:57,744 --> 00:07:00,949
and make all this go away.

111
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:05,484
I know he's
the mastermind here.

112
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,887
Plus...

113
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:12,258
I'm thinking based
on your recent activities

114
00:07:12,293 --> 00:07:14,326
that, uh...

115
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,862
maybe there's a little
trouble in paradise?

116
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:21,800
Maybe you guys aren't,
uh, getting along so good?

117
00:07:21,835 --> 00:07:25,245
I'm right, aren't I?

118
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,164
Eat me.

119
00:07:29,774 --> 00:07:32,563
Sure that's how
you want to play this?

120
00:07:33,545 --> 00:07:37,382
Why don't you try
and beat it out of me?

121
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,438
That's your thing, right?

122
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:52,851
He really did a number
on you, didn't he?

123
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,870
I don't know, but...

124
00:08:03,574 --> 00:08:08,578
happy people
usually don't go around...

125
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,097
throwing millions
of dollars away.

126
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:15,083
I don't think, uh,

127
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:19,020
Walt's gonna be patting you
on the back for that.

128
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,252
But maybe that's the point.

129
00:08:25,194 --> 00:08:27,561
'Cause, you see, I get that.

130
00:08:27,596 --> 00:08:30,297
My own brother-in-law

131
00:08:30,331 --> 00:08:33,238
lying to me for over a year,

132
00:08:35,003 --> 00:08:37,212
using me.

133
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,274
Maybe you understand
that feeling.

134
00:08:44,311 --> 00:08:46,582
Help me out here, Jesse...

135
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:50,082
and we can put him away.

136
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,184
I know you want that.

137
00:08:56,156 --> 00:08:58,156
I think you wanna talk.

138
00:09:03,663 --> 00:09:05,989
Not to you.

139
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:09,568
Agent Schrader.
Beat any good suspects lately?

140
00:09:09,602 --> 00:09:10,602
Hey, tall and taller,

141
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:12,471
ask him his history
with my client.

142
00:09:12,505 --> 00:09:14,439
He knocked
the poor kid unconscious

143
00:09:14,473 --> 00:09:15,606
last time they
were alone together.

144
00:09:15,641 --> 00:09:16,741
So what'll it be, gentlemen,

145
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:18,743
a civil rights lawsuit
the size of Montana?

146
00:09:18,777 --> 00:09:20,445
'Cause I'll oblige you.

147
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:23,648
Oh, so long, Rocky.
Keep your left up.

148
00:09:23,682 --> 00:09:26,383
Detectives,
I'm inviting you to leave.

149
00:09:26,418 --> 00:09:28,152
Okay,
I'm gonna try to remain calm,

150
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:31,855
but will you do me a favor
and tell me what is up with you?

151
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:35,191
My guys are busting their asses

152
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:38,795
trying to hide Walt's money
from the feds,

153
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,130
and you're tossing yours
out a window?

154
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:45,734
And I have to hear about your little act
of philanthropy on the news?

155
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:47,703
Did you hit your head
or something?

156
00:09:47,737 --> 00:09:50,706
Why didn't you call me
the second you got arrested?

157
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,575
What did you say to Schrader?

158
00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:54,543
Nothing. Jesus.
Just chill out.

159
00:09:54,578 --> 00:09:57,279
Chill out? No-- no,
I don't chill out right now,

160
00:09:57,313 --> 00:09:59,882
'cause things
have gone nuclear.

161
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:04,962
I imagine Schrader shared
with you his recent discovery.

162
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,656
Okay, well, then you get
my complete lack of chill.

163
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:13,795
Just use the money
that I gave you.

164
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:15,730
No, Saul. Saul.

165
00:10:15,764 --> 00:10:16,865
I-- Sto-- Saul.

166
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:20,339
Stop talking.
I don't care.

167
00:10:20,602 --> 00:10:22,569
Just-- just make it happen.

168
00:10:22,604 --> 00:10:23,937
Work your magic.

169
00:10:23,972 --> 00:10:25,906
And call me when he's out.

170
00:10:26,975 --> 00:10:28,308
Hey, dad. I'm home.

171
00:10:28,342 --> 00:10:30,611
Oh, okay.
I'll be right out.

172
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:32,946
Hey, you go to work today?

173
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:34,647
You were out late last night.

174
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:38,485
Huh? I-- Well, I, uh...

175
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:41,654
I, uh, I guess I just
lost track of time.

176
00:10:47,432 --> 00:10:49,063
Hello?

177
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,015
- Dad.
- Huh?

178
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,485
I'm, um, I'm gonna
head out, okay?

179
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,520
Where you going?

180
00:11:15,554 --> 00:11:18,122
Uh, Aunt Marie just called.

181
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:22,459
She, uh, she wants me to help
her with some computer thing

182
00:11:22,493 --> 00:11:24,827
and asked me
to stay for dinner.

183
00:11:24,862 --> 00:11:26,436
That cool?

184
00:11:27,365 --> 00:11:30,567
Uh, I guess that, uh...

185
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:33,183
Cool. All right.
See you later.

186
00:11:34,172 --> 00:11:36,739
Wait, uh...
Son?

187
00:11:36,774 --> 00:11:38,107
Junior?
Hang on a second.

188
00:11:38,141 --> 00:11:39,141
Yeah?

189
00:11:39,176 --> 00:11:40,509
Oh, good.
Come on back inside.

190
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:41,843
What happened?

191
00:11:41,878 --> 00:11:42,945
Oh, this? Nothing.

192
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:44,413
No, I'm fine.
It's fine.

193
00:11:44,448 --> 00:11:46,482
Really. I do wanna
talk to you, though.

194
00:11:46,516 --> 00:11:48,484
Okay. Are you okay?

195
00:11:48,518 --> 00:11:50,619
Yeah. Here.
Sit down for a second.

196
00:11:55,357 --> 00:11:58,326
I just don't wanna keep
things from you, okay?

197
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,665
I mean, you deserve to know
what's happening.

198
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:05,733
Yesterday I passed out.

199
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,136
Briefly.
Very-- very briefly.

200
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,775
And I did this.

201
00:12:10,738 --> 00:12:13,926
Why-- why did you pass out?

202
00:12:14,142 --> 00:12:18,545
Well, my latest scans

203
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,783
show a little shadow
on my lung.

204
00:12:23,818 --> 00:12:28,454
But my doctor put me right on
a new round of chemo,

205
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:30,689
which is why I've been
so tired lately.

206
00:12:30,724 --> 00:12:32,725
But I-- I was pushing
myself too hard.

207
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:35,161
I know it. I just don't
want you to worry.

208
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:36,996
I learned my lesson.

209
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,633
Well, um, what's the...

210
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:43,535
What now?

211
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:46,438
What now is that we go on.

212
00:12:46,472 --> 00:12:50,775
Like always.
Right?

213
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:54,279
Hey, don't worry
about this, okay?

214
00:12:54,313 --> 00:12:55,313
I know that's hard.

215
00:12:55,348 --> 00:12:57,449
But I beat this once.

216
00:12:57,483 --> 00:13:00,319
There's no reason to think
I won't again.

217
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:03,920
And my doctor says
I'm doing great.

218
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:06,857
I'm responding really well
to the treatment.

219
00:13:06,891 --> 00:13:08,725
And I'm...

220
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,531
I'm feeling very--
very good about this, all right?

221
00:13:13,565 --> 00:13:16,199
And what would really
help me out

222
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:20,191
is if we all stayed positive.

223
00:13:20,204 --> 00:13:22,199
Can we do that?

224
00:13:22,606 --> 00:13:26,735
Yeah? Hmm?

225
00:13:27,077 --> 00:13:28,747
Okay.

226
00:13:30,446 --> 00:13:32,714
So why don't you go on
and help your Aunt Marie,

227
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:34,749
and-- and we'll talk about this
later with your mom.

228
00:13:34,784 --> 00:13:37,352
No. No-- no way.

229
00:13:37,387 --> 00:13:41,223
I'm staying.
I'm not leaving.

230
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:53,000
- Flynn's not with you, is he?
- No.

231
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:55,169
No.
Why would he be?

232
00:13:57,339 --> 00:13:59,640
How'd it go?

233
00:13:59,675 --> 00:14:01,718
That bad, huh?

234
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,478
How bad are we talking, Hank?

235
00:14:08,716 --> 00:14:10,617
I didn't tell them.

236
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:12,594
Why not?

237
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,388
It's just not time yet.

238
00:14:15,423 --> 00:14:17,490
No, it's past time.

239
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:20,359
Way past time.
We talked about this.

240
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:21,860
You've got to tell them now.

241
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,229
It's just gonna be worse

242
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:26,098
if they find out that
you've kept this from them.

243
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:29,535
Look, it's just I've got some things
I gotta chase down.

244
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:32,003
What? What things?

245
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,805
Leads, you know.

246
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,406
What leads? What?
Something new?

247
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,508
I'm not keeping anything
from anybody, Marie, okay?

248
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,044
Jesus. Don't tell me
how to do my job.

249
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,552
Walt.

250
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:51,098
Are you sure about this?

251
00:14:52,757 --> 00:14:54,991
It's the only way.

252
00:14:59,096 --> 00:15:00,697
Okay.

253
00:15:06,936 --> 00:15:08,871
I'm ready.

254
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,244
My name is
Walter Hartwell White.

255
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,846
I live at
308 Negra Arroyo Lane,

256
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:21,617
Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.

257
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:24,452
This is my confession.

258
00:15:44,313 --> 00:15:46,181
They're here.

259
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:13,039
Thank you for coming.

260
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:22,582
Okay. I'll start.

261
00:16:22,617 --> 00:16:23,749
Skyler and I--

262
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,417
Welcome to Garduno's!

263
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,452
My name's Trent.
I'll be taking care of you today.

264
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,688
Can I start anybody off
with some beverages?

265
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:30,856
Margarita?

266
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,592
How about some of
our tableside guacamole?

267
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:35,828
I-- I think we're fine.

268
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,529
We need some time
with the menu.

269
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,931
No worries.
Be right back with some water.

270
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,037
So you here to confess?

271
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,646
There's nothing to confess.

272
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,915
We're here to talk
about Walter, Jr.

273
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,550
Flynn and Holly
should be living with us.

274
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:01,752
End of story.

275
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:04,655
And while we respect
your opinion,

276
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:08,558
we think that your concern
is misplaced.

277
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:13,328
Skyler and I feel
due to Marie's attempt

278
00:17:13,363 --> 00:17:14,997
to lure him to your house...

279
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:18,100
I wasn't trying to lure him.

280
00:17:18,135 --> 00:17:21,704
Regardless of what
you might call it,

281
00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:25,675
Skyler and I
would like to ask you

282
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:30,111
to please leave
our children out of this.

283
00:17:30,146 --> 00:17:34,582
Junior has been through
a lot already this year.

284
00:17:34,616 --> 00:17:36,284
You are just...

285
00:17:36,318 --> 00:17:38,787
This investigation, Hank--

286
00:17:38,821 --> 00:17:41,422
Do you realize
what this will do to him?

287
00:17:41,456 --> 00:17:42,991
Hearing these things?

288
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:46,326
He's gonna hear it when
I kick in your front door and arrest you.

289
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,204
If... that day ever comes,
so be it.

290
00:17:57,238 --> 00:18:00,807
You have no evidence
to support your claims.

291
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:04,177
Why tear this family apart?

292
00:18:06,213 --> 00:18:09,226
So, how about that guacamole?

293
00:18:11,051 --> 00:18:13,786
We make it right here
at the table.

294
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:21,459
I'll just give you guys
a few more minutes.

295
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:28,280
How can you sit there
and listen to this?

296
00:18:28,601 --> 00:18:31,402
All we want is for
those kids to be safe.

297
00:18:31,437 --> 00:18:32,703
You are putting them in danger,

298
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:34,404
keeping them under
the same roof as this--

299
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:35,906
They are safe, Marie.

300
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:37,708
You yourself sent them
out of the house.

301
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:40,177
And I brought them back.

302
00:18:40,212 --> 00:18:43,714
Look,
whatever you think he did,

303
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:46,851
this is not
an ongoing situation.

304
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:48,718
- Skyler.
- No.

305
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,820
They need to understand.

306
00:18:50,855 --> 00:18:53,123
It's in the past.

307
00:18:53,157 --> 00:18:56,592
It's over.
There is nothing to go after here.

308
00:18:56,627 --> 00:18:58,661
There's nothing to accomplish.

309
00:18:58,695 --> 00:18:59,996
How can we believe
anything you say?

310
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,899
There's no telling
where the lies begin and end.

311
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,434
That affair of yours?
Did that even happen?

312
00:19:05,469 --> 00:19:09,672
Please. Look, Junior just found out
that my cancer is back.

313
00:19:09,706 --> 00:19:13,809
He's already facing the idea
of living without his father.

314
00:19:13,843 --> 00:19:17,935
To put this on top of that?

315
00:19:19,516 --> 00:19:20,615
It's just not right.

316
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,650
I swear to God,

317
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:23,351
you start throwing
the word "right" at me--

318
00:19:23,386 --> 00:19:24,386
What I mean...

319
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,020
Was it right to run
a drug empire?

320
00:19:26,054 --> 00:19:28,055
There is no drug empire.

321
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,791
Lying to your son,
to all of us-- is that right?

322
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:31,426
What do I have to do
to make you believe me?

323
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,253
Why don't you
kill yourself, Walt?

324
00:19:35,698 --> 00:19:36,697
What?

325
00:19:36,731 --> 00:19:38,399
Just kill yourself.

326
00:19:38,433 --> 00:19:39,933
This whole thing
dies with you, right?

327
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:40,967
That's what you're saying here?

328
00:19:41,002 --> 00:19:43,637
Is that Hank
should just let it go

329
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:46,807
and wait for you to die.

330
00:19:46,841 --> 00:19:50,344
Well, maybe you should just
go ahead and die then.

331
00:19:50,378 --> 00:19:53,245
That is not a solution.

332
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,948
No, it's not a solution.

333
00:19:55,982 --> 00:19:58,217
He's not getting off that easy.

334
00:19:58,251 --> 00:19:59,519
Jesus, Hank.

335
00:19:59,553 --> 00:20:01,854
And the same goes for you
if you stick with him.

336
00:20:04,358 --> 00:20:07,059
Both of you think you're just gonna
walk away from this thing?

337
00:20:07,093 --> 00:20:09,127
Never gonna happen.

338
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:10,261
That is not
what we're saying--

339
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:11,763
Enough with the bullshit.

340
00:20:15,501 --> 00:20:18,503
You're not gonna negotiate
your way out of this thing.

341
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:19,938
There's only one solution--

342
00:20:19,972 --> 00:20:22,574
step up, be a man,
and admit what you've done.

343
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:25,275
That's it.
There is no other option.

344
00:20:42,426 --> 00:20:44,594
Let's go.

345
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:03,545
My name is
Walter Hartwell White.

346
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,548
I live at
308 Negra Arroyo Lane,

347
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:10,887
Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.

348
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:13,154
This is my confession.

349
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,723
If you're watching this tape,

350
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:18,093
I'm probably dead--

351
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:22,998
murdered by my brother-in-law,
Hank Schrader.

352
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,934
Hank has been building
a meth empire

353
00:21:25,968 --> 00:21:27,202
for over a year now,

354
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:29,904
and using me as his chemist.

355
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:32,806
Shortly after my 50th birthday,

356
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,276
he asked that I use
my chemistry knowledge

357
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,177
to cook methamphetamine,

358
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,646
which he would then sell

359
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,581
using connections that he made

360
00:21:41,616 --> 00:21:45,318
through his career
with the DEA.

361
00:21:45,352 --> 00:21:48,788
I was... astounded.

362
00:21:48,822 --> 00:21:51,357
I...
I always thought

363
00:21:51,392 --> 00:21:53,492
Hank was a very moral man,

364
00:21:53,527 --> 00:21:56,695
and I was particularly
vulnerable at the time--

365
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,699
something he knew
and took advantage of.

366
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:04,502
I was reeling
from a cancer diagnosis

367
00:22:04,537 --> 00:22:08,373
that was poised
to bankrupt my family.

368
00:22:08,408 --> 00:22:09,874
Hank took me on a ride-along

369
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:11,874
and showed me
just how much money

370
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,779
even a small meth operation
could make.

371
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,798
And I was weak.

372
00:22:16,882 --> 00:22:21,552
I didn't want my family
to go into financial ruin,

373
00:22:21,586 --> 00:22:24,021
so I agreed.

374
00:22:24,056 --> 00:22:26,857
Hank had a partner,
a businessman,

375
00:22:26,891 --> 00:22:28,625
named Gustavo Fring.

376
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,829
Hank sold me into
servitude to this man,

377
00:22:31,863 --> 00:22:35,498
and when I tried to quit,
Fring threatened my family.

378
00:22:35,532 --> 00:22:38,542
I didn't know where to turn.

379
00:22:39,036 --> 00:22:42,772
Eventually, Hank and Fring
had a falling out,

380
00:22:42,806 --> 00:22:45,008
and things escalated.

381
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:48,178
Fring was able to arrange,

382
00:22:48,212 --> 00:22:53,215
uh, I guess-- I guess
you call it a hit on Hank,

383
00:22:53,249 --> 00:22:54,249
and failed,

384
00:22:54,284 --> 00:22:56,018
but he was seriously injured,

385
00:22:56,052 --> 00:22:58,854
and I wound up
paying his medical bills,

386
00:22:58,888 --> 00:23:02,992
which amounted
to a little over $177,000.

387
00:23:03,026 --> 00:23:08,096
Upon recovery,
Hank was bent on revenge.

388
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,832
Working with a man
named Hector Salamanca,

389
00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:14,568
he plotted to kill Fring.

390
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:16,637
The bomb that he used

391
00:23:16,671 --> 00:23:19,392
was built by me.

392
00:23:19,841 --> 00:23:22,809
And he gave me no option
in that.

393
00:23:22,843 --> 00:23:26,384
I have often
contemplated suicide,

394
00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:29,232
but I'm a coward.

395
00:23:30,818 --> 00:23:33,910
I wanted to go to the police,

396
00:23:35,156 --> 00:23:36,956
but I was frightened.

397
00:23:36,991 --> 00:23:39,791
Hank had risen
to become the head

398
00:23:39,826 --> 00:23:41,927
of the Albuquerque DEA

399
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:43,496
to keep me in line,

400
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,331
he took my children.

401
00:23:45,365 --> 00:23:48,068
For three months he kept them.

402
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:52,571
My wife, who had no idea

403
00:23:52,605 --> 00:23:54,805
of my criminal activities,

404
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,875
was horrified to learn
what I had done.

405
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:02,580
I was in hell.

406
00:24:02,614 --> 00:24:07,368
I hated myself for what
I had brought upon my family.

407
00:24:09,087 --> 00:24:12,656
Recently, I tried
once again to quit,

408
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:16,193
and in response,
he gave me this.

409
00:24:26,036 --> 00:24:29,172
I can't take this anymore.

410
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:33,976
I live in fear every day
that Hank will kill me,

411
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:38,276
or worse, hurt my family.

412
00:24:39,015 --> 00:24:43,251
I...
All I could think to do

413
00:24:43,286 --> 00:24:45,454
was to make this video

414
00:24:45,488 --> 00:24:51,392
and hope that the world
will finally see this man

415
00:24:51,426 --> 00:24:54,228
for what he really is.

416
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:08,808
Who do you think
he's shown this to?

417
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:12,438
No one.
It's a threat.

418
00:25:14,115 --> 00:25:17,150
It's what he will do
if I don't back off.

419
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:19,952
I think you should
show this to Ramey.

420
00:25:19,987 --> 00:25:22,421
Just get ahead of it.

421
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:24,189
That video
is a bunch of lies, Hank.

422
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,225
Anybody who knows
you will know.

423
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:29,595
$177,000?

424
00:25:33,433 --> 00:25:35,334
Hell's he talking about?

425
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:42,334
Marie?

426
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:48,248
They told me
it was gambling money.

427
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:52,288
What was gambling money?

428
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:59,089
Oh, Jesus Christ, Marie.

429
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,223
Oh, God, no.

430
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:01,992
How was I supposed to know?

431
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,894
How was I supposed to know
where it really came from?

432
00:26:03,928 --> 00:26:05,529
Why were they paying
for my medical bills?

433
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:06,997
What about my insurance?

434
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:09,398
Insurance wouldn't have covered
the treatment that you needed,

435
00:26:09,432 --> 00:26:11,419
and I...

436
00:26:11,735 --> 00:26:12,935
I just wanted the best for you.

437
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:13,970
Why didn't you tell me?

438
00:26:14,004 --> 00:26:16,305
Because I knew that
you would refuse it,

439
00:26:16,339 --> 00:26:19,709
and without it, you may never
have been able to walk again.

440
00:26:19,743 --> 00:26:22,270
Oh, Christ, Marie.

441
00:26:25,314 --> 00:26:27,983
You killed me here.

442
00:26:28,017 --> 00:26:29,017
I mean, it's the--

443
00:26:29,052 --> 00:26:30,451
that's the last nail.

444
00:26:30,486 --> 00:26:32,788
That's the last nail
in the coffin.

445
00:26:36,258 --> 00:26:38,293
What do we do?

446
00:26:59,146 --> 00:27:01,480
If I were you,
I'd be more nervous.

447
00:27:03,117 --> 00:27:05,018
Ugh. Jesus.

448
00:27:05,052 --> 00:27:06,986
It's always a desert.

449
00:28:05,275 --> 00:28:07,009
Uh, I already checked it.

450
00:28:07,043 --> 00:28:10,112
It's clean. I wouldn't have
driven it here if it wasn't.

451
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:13,149
Um, get one of these,
by the way.

452
00:28:13,183 --> 00:28:16,218
Reads radio signals.
Much easier.

453
00:28:23,058 --> 00:28:24,592
What does he know?

454
00:28:25,928 --> 00:28:29,530
I mean, he knows
you're Heisenberg.

455
00:28:29,564 --> 00:28:31,699
But I figure not much else,

456
00:28:31,733 --> 00:28:34,854
otherwise, you know,
you'd be locked up.

457
00:28:36,204 --> 00:28:39,643
What did he say, exactly?

458
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,210
He wants me to inform on you
for him.

459
00:28:43,244 --> 00:28:46,079
Tell him everything we did.

460
00:28:46,114 --> 00:28:49,382
Anything else?

461
00:28:50,617 --> 00:28:54,829
I don't think he's told
the rest of the DEA.

462
00:28:54,922 --> 00:28:56,789
Why do you say that?

463
00:28:56,824 --> 00:28:59,725
Just him being there
all by himself,

464
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,462
and plus he was
acting kinda shady.

465
00:29:03,496 --> 00:29:06,131
Seemed like he didn't
want the other cops

466
00:29:06,165 --> 00:29:08,832
hearing what he had to say.

467
00:29:09,368 --> 00:29:11,369
Are we gonna talk about
the rain of caca

468
00:29:11,403 --> 00:29:12,938
the kid brought down upon us?

469
00:29:12,972 --> 00:29:14,072
Do you want to hazard a guess

470
00:29:14,106 --> 00:29:15,974
what his little
charity drive cost you?

471
00:29:16,008 --> 00:29:18,109
Why don't you go
take a walk, Saul?

472
00:29:27,485 --> 00:29:31,360
Jesse, will you
let me help you?

473
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:35,470
I don't like to see you
hurting like this.

474
00:29:37,494 --> 00:29:40,776
Maybe it's time for a change.

475
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:44,700
What kinda change?

476
00:29:44,735 --> 00:29:48,794
I don't know.

477
00:29:51,942 --> 00:29:54,405
I don't know.
Maybe...

478
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:58,052
Maybe it's time for you
to just...

479
00:29:58,381 --> 00:30:01,732
leave all of this behind.

480
00:30:02,785 --> 00:30:04,552
Just get out of town.

481
00:30:04,587 --> 00:30:06,955
Don't look back.

482
00:30:12,427 --> 00:30:15,327
Saul knows a man.

483
00:30:15,463 --> 00:30:21,057
He specializes in giving
people new identities.

484
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:25,872
He would move you
someplace far away

485
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:29,056
and set you up with
a whole new life.

486
00:30:30,044 --> 00:30:34,814
Yeah, I know.
Sounds a little extreme.

487
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:41,216
But maybe it's exactly
what you need.

488
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:45,557
You know, I really think
that would be good for you.

489
00:30:45,591 --> 00:30:47,659
A clean slate.

490
00:30:48,795 --> 00:30:51,130
All right.
Just think about it.

491
00:30:51,164 --> 00:30:56,285
You get a job. Something legitimate.
Something you like.

492
00:30:57,102 --> 00:30:59,603
Meet a girl.
Start a family, even.

493
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:03,638
Hell, you're still so damn young.

494
00:31:03,675 --> 00:31:06,961
And what's here
for you now anyway?

495
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:11,882
I tell ya.

496
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:14,829
If I could, I'd trade places.

497
00:31:14,953 --> 00:31:16,853
A whole lifetime ahead of you

498
00:31:16,887 --> 00:31:20,009
with a chance to hit
the reset button.

499
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:25,195
In a few years,
this might all feel

500
00:31:25,229 --> 00:31:28,565
like nothing more
than a bad dream.

501
00:31:40,944 --> 00:31:43,446
Would you just, for once,

502
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,415
stop working me?

503
00:31:47,283 --> 00:31:48,916
What are you talking about?

504
00:31:48,951 --> 00:31:51,419
Can you just, uh,
stop working me

505
00:31:51,454 --> 00:31:53,355
for, like,
ten seconds straight?

506
00:31:53,389 --> 00:31:56,418
Stop jerking me around?

507
00:31:56,525 --> 00:31:59,227
Jesse, I am not working you.

508
00:31:59,261 --> 00:32:02,329
Yes. Yes, you are.

509
00:32:02,364 --> 00:32:05,765
All right? Just drop the whole
concerned dad thing

510
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,434
and tell me the truth.

511
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:10,437
I mean, you're--
you're acting like

512
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:13,440
me leaving town is--
is all about me

513
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:14,774
and turning over a new leaf,

514
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:19,240
but it's really--
it's really about you.

515
00:32:19,275 --> 00:32:21,381
I mean, you need me gone,

516
00:32:21,415 --> 00:32:23,449
'cause your dickhead
brother-in-law

517
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:25,651
is never gonna let up.

518
00:32:25,685 --> 00:32:27,686
Just say so.

519
00:32:27,721 --> 00:32:30,776
Just ask me for a favor.

520
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:34,659
Just tell me you don't
give a shit about me,

521
00:32:34,693 --> 00:32:36,895
and it's either this--

522
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:39,664
it's either this
or you'll kill me

523
00:32:39,698 --> 00:32:42,943
the same way you killed Mike.

524
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:46,949
I mean, isn't that
what this is all about?

525
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,126
Huh? Us meeting
way the hell out here?

526
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:55,446
In case I say no?

527
00:32:58,283 --> 00:33:00,399
Come on.

528
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:04,188
Just tell me you need this.

529
00:34:01,035 --> 00:34:02,501
Your change.

530
00:34:02,536 --> 00:34:04,870
And if you'll hand this
to your car wash professional,

531
00:34:04,905 --> 00:34:06,972
and have an A-1 day.

532
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,314
Skyler?

533
00:34:21,187 --> 00:34:23,688
Skyler, I've got my chemo
in about 45 minutes.

534
00:34:23,722 --> 00:34:26,491
Can you take over
the register for me?

535
00:34:29,228 --> 00:34:31,063
Skyler?

536
00:34:37,902 --> 00:34:40,237
It worked...

537
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,607
and we're fine.

538
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:46,843
Okay?

539
00:34:48,913 --> 00:34:50,728
We're fine.

540
00:35:12,123 --> 00:35:15,298
_

541
00:35:25,848 --> 00:35:27,749
So, Palmer and Castanares

542
00:35:27,783 --> 00:35:29,884
are sitting on that jerkoff
Saul Goodman's office,

543
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,552
keeping an eye
on Jesse Pinkman.

544
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:32,887
Yeah. I put them on it.

545
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,991
You wanna explain that to me?

546
00:35:36,025 --> 00:35:38,059
Yeah. Right.

547
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,060
Why the hell
should I know anything?

548
00:35:40,095 --> 00:35:42,096
They're just my guys,
after all.

549
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:44,464
You gotta tell me
what's going on.

550
00:35:44,499 --> 00:35:46,734
Pinkman is APD's problem,
not ours.

551
00:35:46,768 --> 00:35:48,669
You got a history
with this kid.

552
00:35:48,703 --> 00:35:50,738
He catches wind
that you're trailing him,

553
00:35:50,772 --> 00:35:52,773
and this explodes,
he could sue.

554
00:35:52,807 --> 00:35:55,742
Look, if I can't
explain this to Ramey,

555
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:58,077
I gotta pull my guys.

556
00:35:58,112 --> 00:36:00,546
Fine. Take them off.

557
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,652
I said take them off.
What else you want?

558
00:36:24,003 --> 00:36:25,971
I'm going out for awhile.

559
00:36:26,005 --> 00:36:28,272
Well, you have that 3:00.

560
00:36:28,306 --> 00:36:30,207
Will you be back?

561
00:36:30,241 --> 00:36:32,242
You know what?
It's gonna have to be another day.

562
00:36:32,277 --> 00:36:34,211
Reschedule it.

563
00:36:36,848 --> 00:36:38,315
Last chance.

564
00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:40,350
You sure there's nobody
you wanna say bye to?

565
00:36:40,385 --> 00:36:42,286
Nobody at all?

566
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,386
No.

567
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,721
This is it.

568
00:36:44,755 --> 00:36:47,623
Once I make the call,
there's no take-backs.

569
00:36:54,165 --> 00:36:56,132
Uh, I need a new dust filter

570
00:36:56,167 --> 00:36:59,702
for my Hoover Max Extract
Pressure-Pro, model 60.

571
00:36:59,703 --> 00:37:01,490
Can you help me with that?

572
00:37:02,105 --> 00:37:03,572
Yeah. Pickup.

573
00:37:03,606 --> 00:37:05,607
He's hot.
Uh, not <i>hot</i> hot,

574
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:07,642
just a little hot.

575
00:37:07,677 --> 00:37:10,012
Currently out on bail.

576
00:37:10,046 --> 00:37:12,280
Yeah, he knows the rules.

577
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:14,816
One hour. Okay.
He'll be there.

578
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:19,320
And done.

579
00:37:22,257 --> 00:37:23,958
Okay.

580
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,493
This guy's fee
is one twenty-five.

581
00:37:26,528 --> 00:37:28,863
Your benefactor...

582
00:37:28,897 --> 00:37:31,397
asked me to send you out
with something extra.

583
00:37:31,432 --> 00:37:33,333
Get you started, you know?

584
00:37:33,367 --> 00:37:35,335
Keep you sitting pretty until

585
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:38,238
you get into the groove
of your new life.

586
00:37:38,272 --> 00:37:41,975
Provided, of course, you don't
toss it out the window on the way.

587
00:37:43,277 --> 00:37:46,479
Seriously,
this is the last of it,

588
00:37:46,513 --> 00:37:49,648
so you might wanna think
about making a budget.

589
00:37:49,682 --> 00:37:51,150
Hey, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

590
00:37:51,184 --> 00:37:53,753
You can't fire up a doob in here!
Put that out!

591
00:37:53,787 --> 00:37:55,855
I mean it!
Put it out!

592
00:37:55,889 --> 00:37:59,491
Look, Mr. Natural,
I'm not gonna let you sabotage this thing.

593
00:37:59,525 --> 00:38:02,728
This guy is not gonna take you
if you show up high,

594
00:38:02,762 --> 00:38:06,030
so stop screwing around,
or it's both our asses.

595
00:38:09,969 --> 00:38:11,602
Right. Well,
that's a start.

596
00:38:11,637 --> 00:38:13,638
Now give with the dope.

597
00:38:27,185 --> 00:38:29,987
Christ.

598
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:33,023
Some people are immune
to good advice.

599
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:36,425
I'm gonna get a bag
for this cash.

600
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:39,395
Don't even think
about lighting up again.

601
00:38:40,397 --> 00:38:41,898
Francesca,

602
00:38:41,932 --> 00:38:44,066
we got any bags?

603
00:38:44,101 --> 00:38:47,103
For money.
Money-sized bags.

604
00:38:51,908 --> 00:38:53,875
Huell's gonna drop you
at the pickup spot

605
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,144
then he's gonna get
the hell out of there.

606
00:38:56,179 --> 00:38:58,079
You got that?

607
00:38:58,114 --> 00:39:01,416
Guy won't pick up the kid
if he's got company.

608
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,384
You got a phone?

609
00:39:03,419 --> 00:39:04,920
Cops took it.

610
00:39:07,122 --> 00:39:09,723
All right.
In case something goes wrong--

611
00:39:09,757 --> 00:39:12,759
guy doesn't show, whatever--
you give me a call.

612
00:39:16,431 --> 00:39:19,266
Seriously?
Hello Kitty?

613
00:39:19,301 --> 00:39:20,935
"Seriously?" It's free.

614
00:39:20,969 --> 00:39:23,070
Uh, we got a beggars-choosers
situation here,

615
00:39:23,104 --> 00:39:24,604
so stop busting my balls.

616
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:26,540
Corner of Juan Tabo and Osuna.

617
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:28,208
You, you're gonna sit and wait.

618
00:39:28,242 --> 00:39:30,143
This guy's punctual
with a capital P.

619
00:39:30,177 --> 00:39:33,179
Okay? So don't move.
Don't get up and get an ice cream.

620
00:39:33,214 --> 00:39:35,449
Just stay put like a good boy.

621
00:39:35,483 --> 00:39:36,950
He'll pick you up.
You'll pay him.

622
00:39:36,984 --> 00:39:39,185
He'll take your ID.
He'll give you a new one.

623
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:43,222
Good-bye, Jesse Pinkman.
Hello, Mr. Credit to Society.

624
00:39:44,224 --> 00:39:45,991
So, do I get to pick
where I go?

625
00:39:46,025 --> 00:39:48,561
Well, it's your life.
I imagine you get a say.

626
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:50,763
Want a suggestion?
How about Florida?

627
00:39:50,797 --> 00:39:53,733
You get a tan,
meet the Swedish bikini team,

628
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:55,433
you know,
swim with the dolphins.

629
00:39:55,468 --> 00:39:58,269
What about... Alaska?

630
00:39:58,303 --> 00:39:59,771
Alaska. Okay.

631
00:39:59,805 --> 00:40:01,773
Well, that's a different vibe.

632
00:40:01,807 --> 00:40:03,708
I never figured you
for a big moose lover,

633
00:40:03,743 --> 00:40:05,109
but whatever floats your boat.

634
00:40:05,143 --> 00:40:08,446
Alaska.
Alaska's good.

635
00:40:09,648 --> 00:40:12,182
Anywhere you can get
a fresh start is gonna be good.

636
00:40:12,216 --> 00:40:13,617
You ready?

637
00:40:13,651 --> 00:40:15,419
Yeah.

638
00:40:17,422 --> 00:40:19,423
Take care, Jesse.

639
00:40:21,092 --> 00:40:22,893
All right.

640
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,501
'Scuse me.

641
00:42:15,898 --> 00:42:18,832
Hey, man, you can't go in there!

642
00:42:18,867 --> 00:42:21,768
He a no-show? Why didn't you call?

643
00:42:21,802 --> 00:42:24,304
Why didn't you...

644
00:42:24,339 --> 00:42:26,106
Stop!

645
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:29,743
Code Red!

646
00:42:31,479 --> 00:42:33,346
- Huell!
- No! Hey!

647
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,813
- Hey! No!
- Get in here!

648
00:42:34,848 --> 00:42:37,016
No, no.

649
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,618
Back off!

650
00:42:39,652 --> 00:42:41,854
You, stay where you are.

651
00:42:41,889 --> 00:42:44,456
What? I don't know what happened here.
What did I do?

652
00:42:44,791 --> 00:42:46,559
You stole it off of me.

653
00:42:46,293 --> 00:42:48,861
You and him-- you took it
right out of my pocket, didn't you?

654
00:42:48,896 --> 00:42:50,796
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Calm down. Yes.

655
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:52,964
Okay. I had Huell
lift your dope.

656
00:42:52,999 --> 00:42:55,200
I told you I couldn't risk
the guy not taking you.

657
00:42:55,234 --> 00:42:58,937
No! Before!
The cigarette!

658
00:42:58,971 --> 00:43:01,707
You stole the cigarette.

659
00:43:01,741 --> 00:43:04,777
- What?
- The ricin cigarette!

660
00:43:04,811 --> 00:43:07,278
You had him steal it off of me!

661
00:43:07,312 --> 00:43:09,847
And all for
that asshole Mr. White!

662
00:43:09,882 --> 00:43:12,182
He poisoned Brock!

663
00:43:12,217 --> 00:43:16,053
He poisoned Brock,
and you-- you helped him!

664
00:43:16,087 --> 00:43:19,323
- Okay, Jesse. Calm down.
- Say it again!

665
00:43:19,357 --> 00:43:21,958
Tell me one more time
to calm down! Come on!

666
00:43:21,992 --> 00:43:23,993
I'm sorry. Yes. Okay.

667
00:43:24,028 --> 00:43:26,730
I had Huell lift your cigarette,
but Walt made me!

668
00:43:26,764 --> 00:43:29,966
He told me he was helping you,
he was saving you.

669
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,969
I never would've agreed to it
if I'd known what he was gonna do.

670
00:43:33,003 --> 00:43:34,738
Jesse, you gotta believe me.

671
00:43:34,772 --> 00:43:38,173
I didn't want any of this!

672
00:43:47,627 --> 00:43:48,925
Back up!

673
00:43:56,392 --> 00:43:59,194
Agh! Get off me!
What do I pay you for?

674
00:44:02,565 --> 00:44:05,733
Hey, it's me.
We got a big problem.

675
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,570
...18, 19, and 20.

676
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:11,272
Actually, you gave me a five,
not a one.

677
00:44:11,306 --> 00:44:12,940
Oh, I-- I did.

678
00:44:12,975 --> 00:44:14,442
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

679
00:44:14,476 --> 00:44:17,445
Um, here you go.

680
00:44:17,479 --> 00:44:19,380
Thank you for your honesty.

681
00:44:19,414 --> 00:44:20,814
Oh, and, uh,

682
00:44:20,849 --> 00:44:22,816
please give this
to your car wash professional.

683
00:44:22,851 --> 00:44:24,852
Have an A-1 day.

684
00:44:26,454 --> 00:44:28,721
God.

685
00:44:33,361 --> 00:44:34,827
- Hey.
- Hi.

686
00:44:34,862 --> 00:44:37,864
- What's going on?
- Not much.

687
00:44:41,935 --> 00:44:44,436
- Yeah? Nothing?
- No. Things are fine.

688
00:44:44,471 --> 00:44:46,438
- Good.
- Why?

689
00:44:46,473 --> 00:44:49,241
Oh, no reason.

690
00:44:57,350 --> 00:45:00,985
You know what I...
found the other day

691
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:06,391
is that the-- the-- the latch
on the soda machine wasn't...

692
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:09,693
latching.

693
00:45:09,728 --> 00:45:11,629
It's-- it's catching

694
00:45:11,663 --> 00:45:13,964
every time that I stock
that darn thing.

695
00:45:15,933 --> 00:45:18,268
So I thought I'd check it out.

696
00:45:20,371 --> 00:45:22,705
- Great.
- Okay.

697
00:45:57,106 --> 00:45:59,474
Oh! Exact change.

698
00:45:59,508 --> 00:46:01,509
I like that.
Thank you very much.

699
00:46:03,478 --> 00:46:05,779
Okay.

700
00:46:05,813 --> 00:46:07,981
And...

701
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:11,150
please give this
to your car care professional,

702
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,918
and have an A-1 day.

703
00:46:12,953 --> 00:46:15,221
- Thank you. - Thank you.
- You know what I just remembered

704
00:46:15,255 --> 00:46:17,656
is that they gave me
a prescription to go pick up.

705
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,325
So I forgot.

706
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,962
I'm gonna go head on over
to the drugstore, okay?

707
00:46:22,996 --> 00:46:25,063
- Yeah. Okay.
- All right.

708
00:46:44,406 --> 00:46:46,969

1
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:47,331
Let's break it down.

2
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:51,805
Hydrogen.
What does that give us?

3
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:54,585
By mole?
We're looking at 63%.

4
00:00:54,713 --> 00:00:56,023
63?

5
00:00:57,283 --> 00:00:58,527
That is a big bite.

6
00:00:58,528 --> 00:01:00,219
My next step's
gotta be oxygen.

7
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,734
Oxygen: 26%.

8
00:01:01,818 --> 00:01:04,331
26.
There you have your water.

9
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:05,571
Carbon: 9%.

10
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,467
Carbon: 9.

11
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,091
- For a total of 98%?
- Right.

12
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,182
- Nitrogen: 1.25%.
- 1.25.

13
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:17,710
That brings it
to 99 and a quarter.

14
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,910
Which only leaves you
with the trace elements

15
00:01:21,244 --> 00:01:23,396
down where the magic happens.

16
00:01:24,138 --> 00:01:26,505
Oh, wait a minute.
What about calcium?

17
00:01:26,506 --> 00:01:28,073
Calcium's not a trace.

18
00:01:28,074 --> 00:01:30,021
Got a whole skeleton
to account for.

19
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,860
- You would think, right?
- Right.

20
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:35,764
Calcium. Calcium is only .25%.

21
00:01:35,947 --> 00:01:38,328
What?
That low?

22
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:39,824
Seriously?

23
00:01:40,605 --> 00:01:42,538
Damn, I never would
have thought that.

24
00:01:42,547 --> 00:01:46,030
Okay, so where
does iron fit in?

25
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:48,506
Iron. Wow, okay.

26
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:52,506
.00004%.

27
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:55,798
What?

28
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:58,556
You can't have hemoglobin
without iron.

29
00:01:58,676 --> 00:02:01,426
- Apparently, it don't take much.
- No, it don't. Go figure.

30
00:02:01,575 --> 00:02:04,476
- Sodium.
- Sodium:.04.

31
00:02:07,536 --> 00:02:10,217
Phosphorus:.19.

32
00:02:10,223 --> 00:02:13,887
.19.
There we go.

33
00:02:15,075 --> 00:02:18,121
So, the whole thing...

34
00:02:19,016 --> 00:02:20,507
adds up to...

35
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:24,659
99.888042%.

36
00:02:27,925 --> 00:02:31,870
We are .111958%...

37
00:02:34,265 --> 00:02:35,591
shy.

38
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:37,884
Supposedly
that's everything.

39
00:02:41,336 --> 00:02:43,970
I don't know.
I just... I just...

40
00:02:44,478 --> 00:02:47,602
Just seems like
something's missing, doesn't it?

41
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:51,916
There got to be more
to a human being than that.

42
00:03:03,507 --> 00:03:06,507
"...And the Bag's in the River"

43
00:03:23,498 --> 00:03:25,037
I hate these shoes.

44
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:28,122
These shoes make me look like
I should be changing bedpans,

45
00:03:28,278 --> 00:03:30,800
like I should be squeaking
around bringing soup

46
00:03:30,808 --> 00:03:32,907
to some disgusting old person,

47
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,090
then take the bus home
to my 16 cats.

48
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:37,374
Then why are you
wearing them?

49
00:03:38,492 --> 00:03:39,824
I like the support.

50
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:42,375
My arches happen to be
extremely archy.

51
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:46,570
Yo. What's up?

52
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:49,338
Hey, can you call me,
like, in two minutes?

53
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:51,058
Thanks. Bye.

54
00:03:52,507 --> 00:03:54,465
Gotta go take this.

55
00:03:55,588 --> 00:03:56,739
Female?

56
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,944
Louis.

57
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:03,698
Not like it's any
of your business, though.

58
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:06,424
Just be quick about it.

59
00:04:06,564 --> 00:04:10,251
Oh, and, um,
please don't say yo.

60
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:13,705
You can't know
how much I hate that.

61
00:04:19,165 --> 00:04:22,404
You missed a... spot right there.

62
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:24,900
Should you be
up on that ladder?

63
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:27,522
You're more than welcome
to take over for me up here.

64
00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:29,802
I don't see why you don't
just get Walt to do it.

65
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,610
Yeah.
There's an idea.

66
00:04:35,297 --> 00:04:38,535
So, I'm working
on this new short story,

67
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:42,374
and there's this stoner character in it,
and I'm trying to...

68
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:46,451
Well, know you,
actually, let me back up.

69
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:49,089
You've smoked your

70
00:04:49,238 --> 00:04:51,881
fair share of pot
in college, didn't you?

71
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,368
I mean, you at least tried it.

72
00:04:58,927 --> 00:05:00,078
Come on.

73
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:06,803
I perhaps tried it. Why?

74
00:05:07,113 --> 00:05:09,402
Do you rember it having
an effect on your mood,

75
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:12,109
like changing it
in any major way, or...

76
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:14,796
It made me more serious.

77
00:05:14,923 --> 00:05:15,967
Really?

78
00:05:16,602 --> 00:05:19,123
Because I mostly rember

79
00:05:19,635 --> 00:05:22,256
it made me light-headed.
That's about it.

80
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:25,829
I was just wondering
if it maybe could...

81
00:05:29,838 --> 00:05:32,868
You know, it's just
a character thing I'm stuck on.

82
00:05:33,052 --> 00:05:34,307
Never mind.

83
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:36,749
- Walter Jr.'s on pot?
- What?

84
00:05:36,854 --> 00:05:39,533
No! No.

85
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,198
- What would make you even...
- Where's he getting it from?

86
00:05:42,283 --> 00:05:45,564
- Marie.
- Seriously. Is it this Louis person?

87
00:05:46,174 --> 00:05:48,071
What are you going
to do about this?

88
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:50,578
You need
to look me in the eye.

89
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:54,557
I am strictly asking about a story
that I am writing, that's all.

90
00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:58,442
Right hand to God,
Walter Jr. is not on pot.

91
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,672
Certainly not
as far as I know.

92
00:06:02,978 --> 00:06:04,788
Not as far as you know?

93
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:06,334
Marie.

94
00:07:54,168 --> 00:07:55,521
Look at me.

95
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:59,942
Hey, turn around
and look at me.

96
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:07,333
This...
This here...

97
00:08:08,865 --> 00:08:11,379
I wouldn't do this
to my worst enemy.

98
00:08:13,245 --> 00:08:15,078
This is degrading.

99
00:08:20,162 --> 00:08:21,420
I'm sorry.

100
00:08:22,684 --> 00:08:26,553
You hope I'll make it easy on you
and just drop dead, don't you?

101
00:08:27,338 --> 00:08:28,830
Well, I won't.

102
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,506
So either kill me
or let me go.

103
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,391
You don't have it
in you, Walter.

104
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,414
How do you know my name?

105
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:43,709
Jesse.

106
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:46,598
He told Emilio and me.

107
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,234
When he came by
to sell your meth?

108
00:08:51,636 --> 00:08:54,333
So what?
You threaten him, huh?

109
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:57,218
- Did you beat it out of him?
- Not even close.

110
00:09:00,822 --> 00:09:02,719
What else did he tell you?

111
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,893
Pretty much everything
you can think of.

112
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,566
How you were his
high school teacher.

113
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,728
How one time you taught about carbon
dioxide by making grape soda in class.

114
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,187
How you have a son
who's retarded,

115
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:19,748
or in a wheelchair
or something.

116
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,248
This shouldn't come across
as some news flash.

117
00:09:24,575 --> 00:09:26,515
That partner of yours...

118
00:09:27,007 --> 00:09:28,900
he's got a big mouth.

119
00:09:29,972 --> 00:09:33,616
Walter, I don't know what you
think you're doing here,

120
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:38,429
but trust me, this line of work
doesn't suit you.

121
00:09:41,356 --> 00:09:44,908
So I should just
let you go, then?

122
00:09:44,976 --> 00:09:48,685
Just unlock you
and adios, huh?

123
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,414
I don't see what
real choice you have

124
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,551
if it's between that
and cold-blooded murder.

125
00:09:56,271 --> 00:09:57,464
Besides...

126
00:09:58,926 --> 00:10:01,441
your real problem
is sitting upstairs.

127
00:10:20,595 --> 00:10:21,999
Occupied!

128
00:10:22,648 --> 00:10:25,298
Hey, yo, I'm trying
to pinch one off in here!

129
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:27,623
Just give me
some privacy, would ya?

130
00:10:31,671 --> 00:10:33,217
What the hell, man?

131
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:36,026
What are you doing, man?

132
00:10:36,371 --> 00:10:38,733
- You asshole!
- You told him my name.

133
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,980
- Says who? Him?
- My name, where I work.

134
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:43,572
- You told him about my son!
- Don't touch me!

135
00:10:43,698 --> 00:10:45,501
- Damn junkie!
- No, give me that!

136
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,581
Too late! This is going down
the toilet. Watch it go!

137
00:10:48,595 --> 00:10:50,884
No, that's worth 40 grand,
you stupid shit.

138
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:53,585
It's worth nothing
when you smoke it all.

139
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:55,324
Get off the toilet.

140
00:10:55,704 --> 00:10:57,302
Get off the toilet!

141
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,437
Get off the toilet!

142
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:04,151
Stop it!

143
00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:09,893
No! No way!

144
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,464
What the hell do you
think you're going?

145
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,302
- Back off, man! Jesus!
- We've got work to do!

146
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:56,405
No, you got work to do.
I did my part.

147
00:11:56,413 --> 00:11:59,450
You mean that obscenity that I spent
the last two hours cleaning up?

148
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:02,270
- That is your contribution?
- Yo! Kiss my pink ass, man!

149
00:12:02,273 --> 00:12:04,044
I didn't ask
for any of this!

150
00:12:04,087 --> 00:12:06,203
How am I supposed
to live here now, huh?

151
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,013
My whole house smells like
toe cheese and dry cleaning.

152
00:12:09,024 --> 00:12:11,738
Because you didn't
follow my instructions!

153
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:13,875
Oh, well,
heil Hitler, bitch.

154
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:16,111
And let me tell you
something else.

155
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:19,263
We flipped a coin,
okay?

156
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:20,750
You and me.

157
00:12:20,952 --> 00:12:22,173
You and me!

158
00:12:22,323 --> 00:12:24,624
Coin flip is sacred.

159
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:33,512
Damn it.

160
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:37,514
Your job is waiting for you
in that basement,

161
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,527
as per the coin.

162
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,509
Fucking do it already.

163
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,246
That's what she said.

164
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,150
Yeah, I think we have some of those.
Yeah, you'll have to try them on.

165
00:13:05,214 --> 00:13:07,364
- Hello.
- 7½, maybe. I don't know.

166
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:10,035
Excuse me.
Do you have these in black?

167
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:15,555
Anyway, so like I was saying,
I went to the party the other night.

168
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:17,300
Yeah, Tony was there.

169
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:25,777
Hey, where have you been?
I called you two hours ago.

170
00:13:25,825 --> 00:13:28,385
Sorry, baby. I'm kinda
busy here. What's up?

171
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:32,916
Kind of a lot, actually,
and it's a delicate subject,

172
00:13:32,934 --> 00:13:35,416
so I need you to focus and...

173
00:13:35,491 --> 00:13:37,601
Hey, sit down!
Sit down!

174
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,450
Damn it, Hank.

175
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:42,017
Well, sorry, babe.
I'm just...

176
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,534
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

177
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:47,329
Sit down!
Sit your ass down!

178
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,075
Comprende?
You, too! Sit down!

179
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:50,424
Siéntete!

180
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:56,285
I'm back, baby.
What's up?

181
00:13:56,664 --> 00:13:57,975
Walter Jr.

182
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,976
Yeah,
what about him?

183
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,782
Marijuana.

184
00:14:02,056 --> 00:14:03,859
- He's smoking it.
- Bullshit.

185
00:14:03,903 --> 00:14:06,307
Excuse me.
His own mother seems to think so.

186
00:14:06,327 --> 00:14:08,551
- Skyler told you that?
- She inferred it.

187
00:14:08,587 --> 00:14:10,278
She inferred it, huh?

188
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:13,914
She strongly
inferred it, like...

189
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,494
"Doctor, my friend suffers
from erectile dysfunction."

190
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:21,666
Please, come on already.
I want you to talk to him.

191
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:25,038
Walt should. Skyler, better yet. She'll
kick his butt up and down the block.

192
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:27,226
I think
it ought to be you.

193
00:14:27,294 --> 00:14:29,566
You know, tell him
some horror stories.

194
00:14:29,573 --> 00:14:32,319
Maybe show him
some autopsy pictures.

195
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:34,787
What, autopsy for
a pot overdose? Come on.

196
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,958
I don't know, baby.
It's just that, you know...

197
00:14:37,014 --> 00:14:40,224
I figure his dad should be the one
doing this thing, don't you think?

198
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:42,951
Hank, he respects you.

199
00:14:46,096 --> 00:14:49,889
Yeah, all right. Well, listen,
I'll swing by their place after work.

200
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,845
Good. Scare him straight.

201
00:14:54,007 --> 00:14:55,411
Where's my sugar?

202
00:15:00,118 --> 00:15:02,477
Excuse me, ma'am.
Ma'am.

203
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:05,016
You need to be wearing footies
before you try those on.

204
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:06,791
I'm extremely clean.

205
00:15:06,898 --> 00:15:09,342
Yeah, well,
I'd really appreciate it.

206
00:15:11,398 --> 00:15:13,956
Hey, sorry about that.
Yeah, I'll check.

207
00:15:15,726 --> 00:15:18,092
You know, I hid a pair
for you last week, gray ones,

208
00:15:18,094 --> 00:15:21,182
but my manager found them, and
we had to put them back on the floor.

209
00:16:09,326 --> 00:16:10,766
What do you think?

210
00:16:10,868 --> 00:16:12,112
About what?

211
00:16:13,613 --> 00:16:15,424
This look
like a nice place?

212
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:17,373
No, not really.

213
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,893
Think you'd like
to live here?

214
00:16:20,692 --> 00:16:21,651
No.

215
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,281
- You sure about that?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

216
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:28,764
I thought we were going
to Cold Stone Creamery.

217
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:31,087
Well, a little detour.

218
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:34,641
Figured we'd come over here
and check out how the other half lives.

219
00:16:34,753 --> 00:16:37,443
This here's what we call
the Crystal Palace.

220
00:16:37,557 --> 00:16:40,700
Now you know who lives in the palace?
Meth-heads.

221
00:16:40,894 --> 00:16:43,857
Nasty, skeevy,
meth-heads

222
00:16:43,896 --> 00:16:47,221
who'd sell their grandma's
coochie for a hit.

223
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:50,154
Oh, you think that's funny?
That's funny, huh? Yeah.

224
00:16:50,155 --> 00:16:52,724
Well, let me tell you something.
Every last one of these

225
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:55,996
miserable wastes of skin
got started how?

226
00:16:57,198 --> 00:16:59,540
- How do you think they got started?
- I don't know.

227
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,552
What do you think it was they were
all doing before they graduated

228
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:05,125
to shooting meth in their...?

229
00:17:06,921 --> 00:17:08,433
A gateway drug.

230
00:17:09,002 --> 00:17:10,643
That's what we call it.

231
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:13,407
Dollars to doughnuts,
and I shit you not,

232
00:17:13,488 --> 00:17:15,840
that gateway drug
was marijuana.

233
00:17:16,091 --> 00:17:17,413
Every time.

234
00:17:17,572 --> 00:17:19,530
- You understand?
- Um, yeah.

235
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:22,668
So why are you
telling me this?

236
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,464
'Cause I love you,
you little bastard.

237
00:17:26,238 --> 00:17:28,497
Hey, I was young once,
you know?

238
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:32,418
The world's a messed up place,
you know?

239
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,718
You know,
there was this...

240
00:17:34,725 --> 00:17:37,514
this one time when...
Hey!

241
00:17:37,946 --> 00:17:39,481
Hey! Hey, you!

242
00:17:39,748 --> 00:17:41,490
Yeah, you, princess!

243
00:17:41,847 --> 00:17:43,258
Get over here!

244
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:48,498
Don't make me
get out of the car!

245
00:17:53,249 --> 00:17:54,677
Check this out.

246
00:17:54,855 --> 00:17:56,295
See what I'm talking about.

247
00:17:57,816 --> 00:18:00,517
- I ain't holdin', okay?
- Did I say you could open your mouth?

248
00:18:00,527 --> 00:18:02,350
And hands of the car.

249
00:18:03,103 --> 00:18:05,464
Other side.
Go around the other side.

250
00:18:05,524 --> 00:18:07,314
Talk to my friend here.

251
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,414
What's your name,
sweetheart?

252
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,580
- Wendy.
- Wendy, huh?

253
00:18:14,822 --> 00:18:17,188
How much you charge
for a windy, Wendy?

254
00:18:17,412 --> 00:18:20,457
- I ain't doing him. He's a kid.
- Jesus, was that my question?

255
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:23,114
Don't think so hard.
It's gonna hurt your brain.

256
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:25,141
Are you on the pipe
or the needle?

257
00:18:25,176 --> 00:18:26,375
Nothing. Neither.

258
00:18:26,927 --> 00:18:28,569
Show us your teeth, huh?

259
00:18:28,906 --> 00:18:31,689
Come on, Wendy,
let's see those pearly whites.

260
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:35,215
Oh, God. See that?

261
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:37,418
Pipe. Definitely.

262
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:39,439
Big time. Big time
on the pipe.

263
00:18:39,483 --> 00:18:43,402
- You got something you wanna ask Wendy?
- No, not really.

264
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:46,043
You ever smoke
anything else, Wendy?

265
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,949
Sausages don't count.

266
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:50,983
Seriously.

267
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:53,258
Tell my friend here
how you got started.

268
00:18:53,288 --> 00:18:55,772
You probably used to be,
what, like, a Girl Scout

269
00:18:55,776 --> 00:18:58,857
- or probably sang in a church choir?
- What are you, like, handicapped?

270
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:01,068
He broke his leg
playing football.

271
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:02,756
He's a QB.

272
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:04,824
Got an arm
like a howitzer.

273
00:19:06,606 --> 00:19:09,440
So tell me, Wendy,
do you smoke pot?

274
00:19:09,613 --> 00:19:12,896
- Why, you got some?
- All right. Hoof it. Get lost.

275
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:16,517
Get out of here. Hey, fair warning!
Next time I'm gonna bust you!

276
00:19:24,548 --> 00:19:26,274
So what do you think?

277
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,230
Cool.

278
00:19:38,467 --> 00:19:39,741
Shut the door.

279
00:19:39,753 --> 00:19:41,223
Lock it.
Lock it.

280
00:19:43,086 --> 00:19:44,477
Who the hell was that?

281
00:19:44,496 --> 00:19:47,240
A cop and some football player
messing with me.

282
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:49,689
They ask about me? Huh?

283
00:19:50,376 --> 00:19:52,720
No. I think
they just wanted pot.

284
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:11,818
Oh, shit.
I left my root beer.

285
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,079
LET HIM LIVE

286
00:20:21,615 --> 00:20:24,257
IT'S THE MORAL THING TO DO

287
00:20:26,635 --> 00:20:29,051
WON'T BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH YOURSELF

288
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:35,339
MURDER IS WRONG!

289
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:47,019
KILL HIM, HE'LL KILL YOU ENTIRE
FAMILY IF YOU LET HIM GO

290
00:21:00,702 --> 00:21:01,618
Hello.

291
00:21:01,775 --> 00:21:03,727
Hey, sweetie,
it's me.

292
00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:05,804
Listen, I'm so sorry.

293
00:21:05,954 --> 00:21:09,766
The time, it just completely
got away from me there.

294
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:16,268
My fault. My fault.
Bogdan just kept me here late,

295
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:18,898
you know, doing
some inventory, and...

296
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,814
I've... I should have just...

297
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:25,860
You know, you're right.
I gotta learn to say, you know, no!

298
00:21:27,273 --> 00:21:28,615
But, um...

299
00:21:30,642 --> 00:21:32,219
Sky? You there?

300
00:21:34,484 --> 00:21:36,211
You're at the car wash?

301
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:38,340
Yeah.

302
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:42,139
I seriously doubt that,

303
00:21:42,374 --> 00:21:44,932
since you quit two weeks ago.

304
00:21:50,675 --> 00:21:53,616
I called Bogdan,
looking for you.

305
00:21:55,062 --> 00:21:57,086
Quite an earful
he gave me.

306
00:21:59,224 --> 00:22:00,162
Listen...

307
00:22:02,757 --> 00:22:05,699
Listen, I'll come home,
and we'll talk about it.

308
00:22:06,402 --> 00:22:07,995
I don't think so, Walt.

309
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:08,963
Honey.

310
00:22:09,086 --> 00:22:10,709
Wherever you are...

311
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:14,352
why don't you just
stay there tonight?

312
00:22:14,407 --> 00:22:15,430
Skyler?

313
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:16,932
Skyler?

314
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:20,448
Skyler?

315
00:22:22,939 --> 00:22:23,920
Walter!

316
00:22:27,261 --> 00:22:29,143
Kind of hungry
down here!

317
00:24:32,683 --> 00:24:33,791
Damn.

318
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:37,147
I didn't think
you were coming back.

319
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,213
How long was I out?

320
00:24:54,205 --> 00:24:55,995
10, 15 minutes.

321
00:24:57,982 --> 00:25:01,392
I've never seen someone knock
themselves out just by coughing.

322
00:25:01,546 --> 00:25:04,273
You breathe in the same
thing you used on me?

323
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:14,632
I've got lung cancer.

324
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:41,442
I'll go make you
another sandwich.

325
00:26:18,341 --> 00:26:19,580
It's safe.

326
00:26:21,219 --> 00:26:22,675
There's no poison.

327
00:26:23,532 --> 00:26:24,398
Yeah?

328
00:26:26,337 --> 00:26:28,596
Because that'd be
the way to do it...

329
00:26:29,225 --> 00:26:30,802
if you're gonna do it.

330
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:34,262
I suppose it would.

331
00:26:35,015 --> 00:26:38,213
I mean, you being
a chemist and all.

332
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:57,186
So...

333
00:26:58,051 --> 00:26:59,351
that name...

334
00:27:00,729 --> 00:27:01,984
Krazy-8...

335
00:27:03,069 --> 00:27:05,154
Do I really have
to call you that?

336
00:27:05,627 --> 00:27:07,355
I mean, no offense, but...

337
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,375
don't you have
a real name?

338
00:27:11,786 --> 00:27:12,787
Domingo.

339
00:27:14,622 --> 00:27:15,602
Domingo.

340
00:27:16,517 --> 00:27:18,990
That's "Sunday," right?

341
00:27:21,788 --> 00:27:24,643
I'd rather call you that,
if you don't mind.

342
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,970
Yeah, whatever.

343
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:30,641
I can't say
I ever liked it much.

344
00:27:34,056 --> 00:27:36,400
So, Domingo...

345
00:27:37,353 --> 00:27:41,253
are you from around town
here or someplace else?

346
00:27:41,588 --> 00:27:43,876
Walter,
you getting to know me

347
00:27:43,877 --> 00:27:46,856
is not gonna make it
easier for you to kill me.

348
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,672
Not that I mind,
you understand.

349
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,686
You know,
you keep telling me

350
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:56,644
that I don't have it in me.
Well, maybe.

351
00:27:57,441 --> 00:27:58,825
But maybe not.

352
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:05,591
I sure as hell am looking
for any reason not to.

353
00:28:05,628 --> 00:28:08,063
I mean,
any good reason at all.

354
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,278
Sell me.

355
00:28:17,493 --> 00:28:19,156
Tell me what it is.

356
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:25,049
I guess I'd start off
by promising that,

357
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:27,392
if you let me go,
I won't come after you.

358
00:28:27,431 --> 00:28:29,094
That you'd be safe.

359
00:28:29,488 --> 00:28:32,195
I guess I'd say what happened
between us...

360
00:28:32,473 --> 00:28:33,867
never happened.

361
00:28:33,885 --> 00:28:37,316
And what's best for both parties
is we forget all about it.

362
00:28:38,277 --> 00:28:42,027
But you know that anybody in my
situation would make promises like that.

363
00:28:42,118 --> 00:28:44,505
And though in my case
they happen to be true,

364
00:28:44,661 --> 00:28:46,622
you'd never know
for sure.

365
00:28:50,134 --> 00:28:52,223
So what else
can I tell you?

366
00:28:58,173 --> 00:28:59,622
I don't know.

367
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:03,589
But you gotta convince me.

368
00:29:04,888 --> 00:29:08,212
And you're going nowhere
until you do.

369
00:29:10,064 --> 00:29:11,641
Hey, yeah. Yeah.

370
00:29:12,748 --> 00:29:14,904
I'm from here
in town, man.

371
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:17,893
ABQ. Born and bred.

372
00:29:18,397 --> 00:29:19,676
Never left.

373
00:29:20,832 --> 00:29:23,815
Studied business
administration over at UNM,

374
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:25,932
got my degree.

375
00:29:26,828 --> 00:29:27,851
Really?

376
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:34,388
Does that come in handy
in the drug trade?

377
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:36,346
It doesn't hurt.

378
00:29:37,574 --> 00:29:39,940
I was gonna study
music originally.

379
00:29:40,726 --> 00:29:43,453
Maybe even try out
for Oberlin or Berklee.

380
00:29:43,725 --> 00:29:46,350
My pops talked me
out of it.

381
00:29:47,117 --> 00:29:51,003
Said there was no money in it unless
I wind up some bullshit rock star,

382
00:29:51,245 --> 00:29:54,230
and I didn't have
a snowball chance of that, man.

383
00:29:55,266 --> 00:29:57,035
What does your dad do?

384
00:29:58,513 --> 00:30:01,186
He owns Tampico Furniture
over on Menaul.

385
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,221
Wait a minute.
I know that place.

386
00:30:08,031 --> 00:30:09,710
Wait a minute.
That's...

387
00:30:10,072 --> 00:30:11,819
That's that...

388
00:30:12,684 --> 00:30:15,519
They used to have
those late-night...

389
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:18,713
Those stupid commercials.
Yeah, that's him.

390
00:30:19,225 --> 00:30:22,282
- He's been doing 'em for over 30 years.
- Wait a minute.

391
00:30:22,342 --> 00:30:24,345
How did it go?
It was, uh...

392
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,003
Wait, wait, wait.
It was...

393
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:32,784
Don't let shopping
Strain your brain-o

394
00:30:33,801 --> 00:30:37,308
Just sing this short refrain-o

395
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:41,083
Our forniture is bueno

396
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:44,366
Tampico is the name-o.

397
00:30:55,198 --> 00:30:56,531
Pretty moronic.

398
00:30:56,598 --> 00:30:58,104
But what can you do?

399
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,991
It did tend
to stick in your head.

400
00:31:02,334 --> 00:31:06,219
Did you write that,
being the musician of the family?

401
00:31:06,275 --> 00:31:07,959
Hell, no, man.

402
00:31:08,064 --> 00:31:09,995
It was my crazy Uncle Alex.

403
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:13,499
He sings it at bars,
trying to pick up on women.

404
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,940
In his mind,
it's like saying,

405
00:31:15,955 --> 00:31:18,146
"I wrote Stairway to Heaven."

406
00:31:20,409 --> 00:31:22,688
Wait a minute.
Tampico Furniture.

407
00:31:24,033 --> 00:31:27,970
I think when my son was born
that we bought his bassinet there.

408
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:32,228
We don't sell bassinets there.
It's more of a specialty item.

409
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,381
We did use
to sell cribs.

410
00:31:34,573 --> 00:31:38,027
Oh. Well, a crib, then,
okay? Crib.

411
00:31:38,594 --> 00:31:40,597
Yeah. No, I remember that.

412
00:31:40,874 --> 00:31:42,371
In fact,

413
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:46,389
I remember recognizing your dad
from those commercials.

414
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,944
Although he wasn't...

415
00:31:49,026 --> 00:31:51,141
anywhere near as friendly
in real life.

416
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,512
Yeah, no shit.

417
00:31:53,053 --> 00:31:55,895
Did he try selling you
that extended warranty?

418
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:57,812
Yeah, he probably did.

419
00:31:58,181 --> 00:32:00,655
And I was probably
dumb enough to buy it.

420
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,712
Yeah, that was
his big thing.

421
00:32:03,036 --> 00:32:04,705
You ask him for
a glass of water,

422
00:32:04,731 --> 00:32:07,869
he'll tell you you need
an extended warranty on the ice.

423
00:32:11,587 --> 00:32:14,395
- So did you work there, too?
- Only my whole life,

424
00:32:14,664 --> 00:32:17,662
up until the day
I said "fuck you" and quit.

425
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:22,774
So, uh...

426
00:32:25,078 --> 00:32:28,083
16 years ago, how old
would you have been?

427
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:32,031
It was after school.
Trust me, I was there.

428
00:32:32,432 --> 00:32:34,499
Might have even
helped ring you up.

429
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:37,744
You and your extended
warranty on the crib.

430
00:32:46,995 --> 00:32:48,316
Small world.

431
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:51,721
That it is.

432
00:32:53,707 --> 00:32:55,732
The paths we take, huh?

433
00:33:19,503 --> 00:33:20,539
You...

434
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:23,695
Jesse know you got cancer?

435
00:33:27,027 --> 00:33:28,605
No one but you.

436
00:33:30,757 --> 00:33:32,280
Not your family?

437
00:33:32,515 --> 00:33:33,453
No.

438
00:33:35,423 --> 00:33:36,489
Why not?

439
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:44,436
Not a conversation I'm even
remotely ready to have.

440
00:33:47,838 --> 00:33:49,968
That's why
you're cooking meth?

441
00:33:50,791 --> 00:33:53,285
You want to leave money
for your family.

442
00:33:55,428 --> 00:33:59,077
Hell, I'll write you a check
right now if you let me go.

443
00:34:05,614 --> 00:34:07,319
Like I said, Walter,

444
00:34:08,374 --> 00:34:11,144
this line of work
doesn't suit you, man.

445
00:34:16,086 --> 00:34:18,239
Get out
before it's too late.

446
00:34:24,685 --> 00:34:26,613
I don't know what to do.

447
00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:38,015
Yeah. You do.

448
00:34:57,884 --> 00:34:59,412
I'll get the key.

449
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,637
No, don't do this.
Don't do this.

450
00:37:03,649 --> 00:37:05,566
Why are you doing this?

451
00:37:06,903 --> 00:37:08,822
Why are you doing this?

452
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,062
You're doing
the right thing, Walter.

453
00:37:51,919 --> 00:37:53,377
Do you want to...

454
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:11,655
So... you're not angry?

455
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:14,218
How do you mean?

456
00:38:15,035 --> 00:38:16,181
Angry?

457
00:38:17,513 --> 00:38:18,430
No.

458
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,143
Live and let live, man.

459
00:38:23,737 --> 00:38:25,609
That's very understanding.

460
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:27,596
Whatever, man.

461
00:38:28,177 --> 00:38:29,924
I just want to go home.

462
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,318
Me, too.

463
00:38:45,705 --> 00:38:47,261
Unlock me, Walter.

464
00:39:03,464 --> 00:39:04,978
The moment I do...

465
00:39:07,307 --> 00:39:10,247
are you gonna stick me
with that broken piece of plate?

466
00:39:39,066 --> 00:39:40,260
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

467
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:55,110
I'm sorry.

468
00:39:56,265 --> 00:39:57,636
I'm so sorry.

469
00:41:27,249 --> 00:41:28,518
Hello?

470
00:41:30,003 --> 00:41:31,687
Anybody down here?

471
00:42:39,797 --> 00:42:40,943
Everybody!

472
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:45,093
I need you all
to take your seats.

473
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:48,270
Settle down, please.
Thank you.

474
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:50,998
I understand
that Mr. White

475
00:42:51,016 --> 00:42:54,006
is feeling a little under
the weather this morning,

476
00:42:54,314 --> 00:42:56,382
so you folks
are going to have

477
00:42:56,394 --> 00:42:59,029
to be making do with me today.

478
00:42:59,314 --> 00:43:01,829
And we are going
to be watching

479
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:04,949
a very interesting video on...

480
00:43:05,591 --> 00:43:06,678
carbon.

481
00:43:07,747 --> 00:43:09,388
Very important stuff.

482
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,887
- So what do you think?
- It's a cook site. Gotta be.

483
00:43:16,249 --> 00:43:19,137
Nobody came way the hell
out here just to buy.

484
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:22,456
Fire there could have
started by accident.

485
00:43:22,612 --> 00:43:25,585
Don't look like it was
meant to destroy evidence.

486
00:43:25,858 --> 00:43:29,237
Got a couple of Dually tracks
headed away towards the road.

487
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,574
So, what, they're
in some kind of camper/lab.

488
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:36,111
They accidentally start a fire,
and everybody F.O.'s?

489
00:43:36,189 --> 00:43:37,750
Yeah, why not?

490
00:43:37,996 --> 00:43:41,581
Except why would that little
hair-gelled shit leave his car?

491
00:43:43,302 --> 00:43:45,544
I-yi-yi, Gomie!

492
00:43:45,899 --> 00:43:47,512
It's a culture in decline.

493
00:43:47,531 --> 00:43:49,102
It's a rich and vibrant culture.

494
00:43:49,124 --> 00:43:51,500
It's a car that
jumps up and down.

495
00:43:52,203 --> 00:43:53,496
What the hell?

496
00:43:53,585 --> 00:43:56,662
You people used to be conquistadors,
for Christ's sake.

497
00:43:56,729 --> 00:44:00,297
Smells like a Drakkar Noir
factory in here.

498
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,228
I already searched it.

499
00:44:06,249 --> 00:44:08,079
You're wasting your time.

500
00:44:09,107 --> 00:44:10,129
Give it up.

501
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:11,815
If this here's a trap car,

502
00:44:11,827 --> 00:44:15,092
it's gonna take more than
your dumb white ass to find it.

503
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:18,608
You are talking to the trap car
master, my friend.

504
00:44:19,426 --> 00:44:22,025
I'm Rain Man
counting his toothpicks.

505
00:44:22,181 --> 00:44:24,063
Yeah, you're like Rain Man.

506
00:44:24,152 --> 00:44:25,489
Retarded.

507
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,213
Yeah, baby.

508
00:44:38,012 --> 00:44:40,230
- Hello, Zippy.
- Asshole!

509
00:44:41,356 --> 00:44:43,632
I'd say that looks
like meth, but it's...

510
00:44:43,821 --> 00:44:45,504
it's too damn white.

511
00:44:47,822 --> 00:44:50,148
You know what
I'm thinking, Gomie.

512
00:44:50,638 --> 00:44:52,633
Somebody
croaked our snitch.

513
00:44:52,734 --> 00:44:54,161
Hey, agents!

514
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,895
You got something?

515
00:45:31,015 --> 00:45:32,777
I don't know. Just...

516
00:45:33,927 --> 00:45:36,135
Doesn't it seem like...

517
00:45:36,413 --> 00:45:38,198
something's missing?

518
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:41,288
What about the soul?

519
00:45:53,056 --> 00:45:54,484
The soul.

520
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:05,233
There's nothing
but chemistry here.

521
00:47:10,793 --> 00:47:11,730
Skyler.

522
00:47:22,458 --> 00:47:25,046
There's something
I have to tell you.

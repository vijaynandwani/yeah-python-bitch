is breakfast or lunch.

You know, I really did
a lot of research,

35

and, I don't know,

36
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,860
this car just really
stood out to me.

37

39
00:04:06,434 --> 00:04:07,668
It's really roomy,

40
00:04:07,703 --> 00:04:10,642
so you can carpool
with all your friends,

41
00:04:10,677 --> 00:04:12,278
and of course it is safe

42

Oh, and it has a CD player,

Mr. Beneke,
I have some bad news.

Uh...

69
00:05:16,837 --> 00:05:18,273
nothing but, lately.

70
00:05:18,308 --> 00:05:20,675
Your great-aunt Birgit
passed away.

I'm sorry, who?

72

Uh...

73
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:26,786
Apparently, she passed away

74
00:05:26,821 --> 00:05:28,022
in Diekirch, Luxembourg,

75
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:30,594
and this was, wow,
eight years ago.

76
00:05:30,627 --> 00:05:32,365
I just assumed
you two were close,

77
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,565
given that--

78
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,339
Well, maybe this is good news.

[chuckles]

80
00:05:38,442 --> 00:05:40,479
Birgit left behind
a sizable estate,

81
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:43,917
of which you, Mr. Beneke,
are the primary beneficiary.

82
00:05:43,953 --> 00:05:47,458
- What? - Yeah, well, seems she had
no immediate relatives,

83
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:49,394
so the estate's
just been sitting

84
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,764
while the folks over in the EU

85
00:05:50,797 --> 00:05:52,968
searched for a living heir.

86
00:05:54,706 --> 00:05:58,880
I don't know of any relatives
in Luxembourg,

87
00:05:58,915 --> 00:06:00,919
definitely no one who
would name me in their will.

88
00:06:00,954 --> 00:06:02,155
Huh.

89
00:06:04,192 --> 00:06:05,428
Well...

90

Ah, here you go.

91
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,271
She left no will,

92
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:12,743
so that's probably
why it took so long.

93
00:06:12,778 --> 00:06:14,814
They traced the inheritance
through to your father,

94

00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:53,012
Just do not call your mother.

166
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:55,949
Why not?

167
00:13:57,923 --> 00:13:59,491
Because...

168
00:14:00,994 --> 00:14:02,430
I was gambling.

169
00:14:05,203 --> 00:14:07,805
If you tell your mother,

170
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,275
God, I just would--

171
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:13,114
I would never,
never hear the end of it,

172
00:14:13,148 --> 00:14:15,084
so please...

173
00:14:20,428 --> 00:14:23,200
can we just keep this
between us?

174
00:14:23,234 --> 00:14:24,739
Would you do that for me?

175
00:14:25,808 --> 00:14:29,215
Just keep it to yourself.

176
00:14:30,818 --> 00:14:32,520
I don't understand.

177
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:34,425
How'd you get into a fight?

178
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,395
And with who?

179
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:44,844
[weeping]

180
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:53,027
I made a mistake.

181
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:02,678
And it's my own fault.

182
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:09,857
I had it coming.

183
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:13,097
Dad, it's okay.

184
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,776
It's all my fault.

185
00:15:21,514 --> 00:15:26,156
I just-- I'm sorry.

186
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:32,336
I'm sorry.

187
00:15:32,369 --> 00:15:34,472
Dad...

188
00:15:34,506 --> 00:15:35,941
come here.

189
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:41,217
Come on.
Dad, it's okay.

190
00:15:41,251 --> 00:15:44,222
[sobbing]
Hey-- Hey--

191
00:15:44,256 --> 00:15:46,562
It's okay.

192
00:15:46,596 --> 00:15:48,396
Please, it's--
it's okay.

193
00:15:48,431 --> 00:15:49,999
Look at me.
Look at me.

194
00:15:51,002 --> 00:15:52,170
It's okay.

195
00:15:52,205 --> 00:15:54,342
It is.
Come on.

196
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:56,044
Come on.

197
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,397
It's okay.

198
00:16:11,142 --> 00:16:15,684
Hey, how was your birthday?

199
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:20,058
Good.
Get some rest.

200
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:21,260
Okay.

201
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:25,668
The new car?

202
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:29,944
Did you drive it here?

203
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:30,944
Yeah.

204
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:32,046
Hm.

205
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:34,886
Hm.

206
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,389
[sedated]
That's good.

207
00:16:37,725 --> 00:16:39,328
You like it?

208
00:16:41,231 --> 00:16:43,736
Uh, sure.

209
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,440
I do.

210
00:16:46,678 --> 00:16:48,479
It drives great.

211
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,186
That's good, Jesse.

212
00:19:07,306 --> 00:19:08,943
[beeping]

213
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:10,913
[growls] Yes.

214
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:13,283
Well done.

215
00:19:16,724 --> 00:19:17,991
First of many.

216
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:22,636
Yeah?

217
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,772
What's that mean?

218
00:19:23,806 --> 00:19:24,872
You're staying.

219
00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:26,710
You belong to the cartel now.

220
00:19:35,329 --> 00:19:37,331
You can't come
to my work like this.

221
00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:39,000
You're too recognizable.

222
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:41,038
Your face is plastered

223
00:19:41,073 --> 00:19:44,213
on every bus bench
within a 5-mile radius.

224
00:19:44,246 --> 00:19:46,182
Celebrities have
to get their cars washed,

225
00:19:46,215 --> 00:19:48,253
just like everybody else.

226
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,858
Look, I wouldn't have come
if it wasn't important.

227
00:19:50,894 --> 00:19:52,861
Okay?
What is it?

228
00:19:52,896 --> 00:19:56,499
I went ahead and met
with your Mr. Beneke,

229
00:19:56,534 --> 00:20:00,809
which I will say again,
loudly and for the record, bad idea.

230
00:20:00,843 --> 00:20:04,682
Yes, but it is better
than prison. Correct?

231
00:20:04,715 --> 00:20:06,017
Marginally,

232
00:20:06,052 --> 00:20:08,388
which is why I disbursed
the funds as you requested.

233
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:09,890
All right, good.

234
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:12,397
Yeah, I can't believe
he actually bought it--

235
00:20:12,431 --> 00:20:14,033
"Great-aunt Birgit."

236
00:20:14,068 --> 00:20:16,673
What?
But you called it.

237
00:20:16,707 --> 00:20:19,178
I guess people see those zeroes
dance before their eyes,

238
00:20:19,211 --> 00:20:20,681
it's kind
of like highway hypnosis.

239
00:20:20,714 --> 00:20:21,782
All right,
so what's the problem?

240
00:20:21,818 --> 00:20:23,787
Let's just say you and I

241
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:25,891
don't wear the same
rose-colored glasses

242
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,062
where Johnny Fabulous
is concerned,

243
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:29,664
so I kept an eye
on his bank accounts,

244
00:20:29,698 --> 00:20:31,401
and I pulled his credit report.

245
00:20:31,436 --> 00:20:34,539
If you would,
note the time on that.

246
00:20:37,881 --> 00:20:42,155
3:54 p.m. yesterday.

247
00:20:42,189 --> 00:20:44,126
Three hours
after leaving my office.

248
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:47,533
He bought a Mercedes SL550.

249
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:49,939
He's actually leasing it,
but he put 4,500 down.

250
00:20:49,973 --> 00:20:51,676
He's going to pay
1,830 a month--

251
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,144
fully loaded.

252
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:55,148
I mean, he even got
the heated steering wheel,

253
00:20:55,182 --> 00:20:57,086
but that's upwards of 6,300

254
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,025
that won't be going to the IRS.

255
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,194
I just thought
you might like to know,

256
00:21:01,229 --> 00:21:04,536
loath as I am to say
I told you so.

257
00:21:10,514 --> 00:21:11,750
Where is he now?

258
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:40,103
[chuckles]

259
00:21:56,634 --> 00:21:58,337
[sighs]

260
00:22:10,494 --> 00:22:11,663
Hey.

261
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,601
[groans]

262
00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:17,073
How you doing?

263
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:21,615
Good.

264
00:22:29,196 --> 00:22:31,167
How are you?

265
00:22:32,736 --> 00:22:36,444
I'm fine, but your mother
is going to be worried sick.

266
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:39,649
I called her last night.

267
00:22:43,022 --> 00:22:46,863
I told her I was spending
the night at Louis'.

268
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:48,933
It's cool.

269
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:53,408
So h-h-how are you?

270
00:22:56,481 --> 00:22:57,951
I'm fine, son.

271
00:22:57,984 --> 00:22:59,186
I--

272
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,093
I--

273
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:10,307
I took these painkillers

274
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,344
that I had left over
from my surgery,

275
00:23:12,377 --> 00:23:15,214
and I made
the brilliant decision

276
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,619
to wash them down
with a couple of beers.

277
00:23:20,058 --> 00:23:23,129
Not my most sterling moment,
I admit,

278
00:23:23,164 --> 00:23:26,536
but I'm fine.

279
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,942
I wish I could take back
last night.

280
00:23:29,977 --> 00:23:32,146
It was your birthday.
This shouldn't be on your mind.

281
00:23:32,182 --> 00:23:33,815
It's okay.

282
00:23:33,851 --> 00:23:34,985
No, it's not okay.

283
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,587
I'm your father,

284
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:38,359
and I don't want

285
00:23:38,393 --> 00:23:40,829
last night to be--

286
00:23:40,864 --> 00:23:45,806
I mean, you really--

287
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,013
you can't think of me like...

288
00:23:50,517 --> 00:23:51,853
Like what?

289
00:23:55,695 --> 00:23:58,867
I don't understand.

290
00:24:11,156 --> 00:24:13,525
My father died when I was 6.

291
00:24:13,561 --> 00:24:14,763
You knew that, right?

292
00:24:14,796 --> 00:24:15,999
Yeah.

293
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:20,806
He had Huntington's Disease.

294
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:23,713
It's--

295
00:24:23,747 --> 00:24:27,185
destroys portions of the brain,

296
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,659
affects muscle control,
leads to dementia.

297
00:24:30,694 --> 00:24:32,895
It's just a nasty disease.

298
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,102
It's genetic.

299
00:24:35,136 --> 00:24:37,271
It terrified my mother
that I might have it,

300
00:24:37,304 --> 00:24:40,778
so they ran tests on me
when I was a kid,

301
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,550
but I came up clean.

302
00:24:44,286 --> 00:24:50,297
My father fell very ill
when I was 4 or 5.

303
00:24:50,331 --> 00:24:52,167
He spent a lot of time
in the hospital.

304
00:24:53,771 --> 00:24:55,340
My--

305
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,545
[chuckles]

306
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,117
My mother would tell me
so many stories

307
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,587
about my father.

308
00:25:03,622 --> 00:25:05,560
She would talk about him
all the time.

309
00:25:07,097 --> 00:25:09,901
I knew about his personality,

310
00:25:09,936 --> 00:25:11,837
how he treated people.

311
00:25:11,872 --> 00:25:13,975
I even knew how he liked
his steaks cooked--

312
00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:15,245
medium rare.

313
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:17,113
[both chuckle]
Just like you.

314
00:25:19,586 --> 00:25:23,157
I knew things about my father.

315
00:25:23,192 --> 00:25:24,730
I had a lot of information.

316
00:25:24,763 --> 00:25:28,535
It's because people
would tell me these things.

317
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:32,074
They would paint this picture

318
00:25:32,108 --> 00:25:35,482
of my father for me,

319
00:25:35,517 --> 00:25:37,654
and I always pretended

320
00:25:37,688 --> 00:25:40,259
that was who I saw, too,

321
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:41,661
who I remembered,

322
00:25:41,696 --> 00:25:44,066
but it was a lie.

323
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:51,179
In truth, I only have one real,
actual memory of my father.

324
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:57,357
It must've been
right before he died.

325
00:25:57,391 --> 00:26:00,093
My mother would take me
to the hospital to visit him,

326
00:26:00,129 --> 00:26:03,169
and I remember
the smell in there,

327
00:26:03,202 --> 00:26:04,537
the chemicals.

328
00:26:04,572 --> 00:26:07,309
It was as if they use up

329
00:26:07,344 --> 00:26:09,914
every single cleaning product
they could find

330
00:26:09,948 --> 00:26:11,550
in a 50-mile radius...

331
00:26:13,121 --> 00:26:15,992
like they didn't want you
smelling the sick people.

332
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,466
Oh, there was this stench

333
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,004
of Lysol and bleach.

334
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,040
You could just feel it
coating your lungs.

335
00:26:24,142 --> 00:26:28,618
Anyway, there,
lying on the bed,

336
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,122
is my father.

337
00:26:32,794 --> 00:26:36,466
He's all--
He's all twisted up.

338
00:26:39,506 --> 00:26:45,249
And my mom,
she puts me on her lap.

339
00:26:45,281 --> 00:26:46,851
She's sitting
on the bed next to him

340
00:26:46,886 --> 00:26:49,755
so I can get
a good look at him...

341
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:53,463
but really he just scares me...

342
00:26:56,939 --> 00:26:59,609
and he's looking right at me...

343
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:05,184
but I can't even be sure
that he knows who I am.

344
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:12,966
And your grandmother

345
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,636
is talking,

346
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:18,776
trying to be cheerful,
you know, as she does,

347
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,880
but the only thing
I could remember

348
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:24,889
is him breathing.

349
00:27:27,194 --> 00:27:29,365
Oh, th-- this--

350
00:27:31,468 --> 00:27:35,141
this rattling sound,

351
00:27:35,174 --> 00:27:38,880
like if you were shaking
an empty spray-paint can.

352
00:27:38,914 --> 00:27:40,382
Huh?

353
00:27:45,158 --> 00:27:47,527
Like there was nothing in him.

354
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,242
Anyway...

355
00:27:57,483 --> 00:28:01,322
that is the only real memory
that I have of my father.

356
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:10,172
I don't want you to think of
me the way I was last night.

357
00:28:13,111 --> 00:28:14,815
I don't want that

358
00:28:14,848 --> 00:28:16,785
to be the memory you have of me

359
00:28:16,818 --> 00:28:18,321
when I'm gone.

360
00:28:20,126 --> 00:28:23,029
R-Remembering you that way...

361
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,169
wouldn't be so bad.

362
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:32,848
The bad way to remember you
would be the way--

363
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,324
the way you've been
this whole last year.

364
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:41,799
At least last night
you were--

365
00:28:41,832 --> 00:28:44,170
you were real.

366
00:28:44,205 --> 00:28:45,772
You know?

367
00:28:52,751 --> 00:28:53,953
Bye.

368
00:29:24,546 --> 00:29:25,848
Somewhere you should be?

369
00:29:29,623 --> 00:29:32,328
Basically it was
a temporary hiatus,

370
00:29:32,361 --> 00:29:33,530
but you give us two weeks,

371
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,704
we will be up and running 100%.

372
00:29:36,738 --> 00:29:39,308
All right, you talk to your
people and get back to me. Okay?

373
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,783
Yeah, thanks, Tanya.

374
00:29:43,818 --> 00:29:45,185
Okay, you bet.

375
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,589
Say hi to the kids for me.

376
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,692
Hey.
Hi.

377
00:29:49,729 --> 00:29:51,031
Nice surprise.

378
00:29:51,065 --> 00:29:52,366
What's up?

379
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,872
Just thought I'd swing by,
see how things were going.

380
00:29:54,905 --> 00:29:56,408
Well, things are--

381
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:58,344
[chuckles]
...things took a turn.

382
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,449
It's kind of crazy.

383
00:29:59,482 --> 00:30:00,816
Oh, yeah?

384
00:30:00,852 --> 00:30:02,219
I think the universe is trying
to tell me something.

385
00:30:02,254 --> 00:30:04,725
I've got some good news,
some very good news,

386
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:08,331
and getting
the business going again.

387
00:30:10,403 --> 00:30:11,737
Wow.
[chuckles]

388
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,076
Yeah, I figure
we haven't been down long,

389
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,845
so we should be able to get
most of our old contracts back.

390
00:30:15,879 --> 00:30:17,114
Sit down.

391
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,517
Oh, thank you.

392
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:22,157
That's-- gosh, that's--

393
00:30:23,528 --> 00:30:25,061
that's wow.
[laughs]

394
00:30:25,096 --> 00:30:27,334
How is that even possible?

395
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:33,478
I got a very unexpected
cash infusion.

396
00:30:33,512 --> 00:30:34,680
Huh.

397
00:30:34,716 --> 00:30:37,053
Guess someone's
looking out for me.

398
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:39,357
I guess so.

399
00:30:39,391 --> 00:30:42,997
Is that yours outside?

400
00:30:43,032 --> 00:30:46,303
Oh, yeah, you know.

401
00:30:46,339 --> 00:30:48,809
Can't be driving a piece of
crap to customer meetings.

402
00:30:48,845 --> 00:30:50,313
You've got to present
that successful image.

403
00:30:50,346 --> 00:30:51,615
Yeah, right, right.

404
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:55,790
So the IRS stuff--
that's resolved?

405
00:30:55,825 --> 00:30:57,527
Yeah, it's in progress.

406
00:30:57,561 --> 00:30:58,896
So you paid them?

407
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:00,400
Well, not yet, but I will.

408
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,138
When?

409
00:31:03,172 --> 00:31:06,445
Well, it's not that simple.

410
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,216
Um, here's the thing.

411
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,453
I never had
proper legal counsel,

412
00:31:11,489 --> 00:31:12,922
so I was thinking

413
00:31:12,957 --> 00:31:15,795
I should hire someone good

414
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:17,131
who can maybe hammer out
a better deal.

415
00:31:17,165 --> 00:31:20,235
There will never be
a better deal, Ted.

416
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:22,806
The deal is you pay
your back taxes,

417
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,010
you pay your penalty,

418
00:31:24,045 --> 00:31:25,946
and you don't go to prison.

419
00:31:25,981 --> 00:31:27,416
That's a good deal,

420
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,855
so let's keep our priorities
straight here, right?

421
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:36,097
Well, my priority
is getting my business back

422
00:31:36,131 --> 00:31:37,902
and putting my employees
back on the payroll

423
00:31:37,935 --> 00:31:40,706
so they can pay
their mortgages.

424
00:31:40,741 --> 00:31:44,378
Right, but I think
your employees would agree

425
00:31:44,414 --> 00:31:47,519
that you need to get your
financial situation in control

426
00:31:47,552 --> 00:31:48,787
before you can help them.

427
00:31:49,823 --> 00:31:52,561
Boy, IRS got you on commission?

428
00:31:52,595 --> 00:31:54,700
No, I'm just saying that,
though I really do--

429
00:31:54,734 --> 00:31:58,306
I understand the temptation
to restart the business,

430
00:31:58,341 --> 00:31:59,642
maybe the universe
is telling you

431
00:31:59,677 --> 00:32:02,580
that you need
to pay what you owe.

432
00:32:05,754 --> 00:32:08,459
Skyler, this is my money...

433
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:13,735
and why are we having
this conversation?

434
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:15,704
You're no longer
a part of my life--

435
00:32:15,741 --> 00:32:19,445
a decision you made,
by the way--

436
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:22,083
so I don't understand why
you're hectoring me about this.

437
00:32:24,124 --> 00:32:25,590
Ted, this affects both of us.

438
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:26,892
No, it doesn't.

439
00:32:26,927 --> 00:32:28,362
I'm telling you,
you need to drop this.

440
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:31,266
You need to use that money
to pay your bill

441
00:32:31,302 --> 00:32:32,903
by the end of this month,

442
00:32:32,937 --> 00:32:34,740

in writing,

443
00:32:34,775 --> 00:32:36,075
that you would do.

444
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:38,315
It is that simple.

445
00:32:40,152 --> 00:32:41,320
Okay.

446
00:32:43,024 --> 00:32:44,594
Okay, duly noted.

447
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,296
What does that mean?

448
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:49,436
Does that mean yes?
Because I really need a yes here, Ted.

449
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,241
All right, Skyler,
I'll tell you what it means.

450
00:32:52,275 --> 00:32:55,080
It means, in the most

1
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:19,675
Son of a...

3
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,360
I'm not leaving.

4
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:17,952
Walt, I'm not leaving.

5
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,216
Oh, my god.

6
00:02:28,544 --> 00:02:30,016
Ah.

7
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:33,824
I can hear
your cell phone ringing!

8
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:38,336
This is ridiculous.
I can't...

9
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,752
Ah.

10
00:02:42,784 --> 00:02:45,504
Uh, what is going on with you?

11
00:02:45,536 --> 00:02:47,776
I've left you,
like, 23 messages.

12
00:02:47,808 --> 00:02:48,896
And?

13
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,976
And?

14
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,176
We need to
talk about the car wash.

15
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,928
You know, Skyler, now is not
a good time for me, okay?

16
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,240
Can we talk about this later?

17
00:02:58,272 --> 00:02:59,840
No, okay? We can't.

18
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:04,384
Why are you do...

19
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,880
Oh, Jesus.

20
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:08,064
What happened?

21
00:03:08,096 --> 00:03:09,792
Nothing. I just
bumped it. That's all.

22
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:12,288
Okay, I'm... I'm coming in.

23
00:03:19,904 --> 00:03:24,224
Okay, exactly what happened?

24
00:03:24,256 --> 00:03:28,160
It's complicated, and I
don't wish to discuss it.

25
00:03:28,192 --> 00:03:29,216
It's none of your concern.

26
00:03:29,248 --> 00:03:30,304
Are you in danger?

27
00:03:31,904 --> 00:03:33,856
Uh...

28
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:38,304
Walt, I need you
to look me in the eye

29
00:03:38,336 --> 00:03:41,376
and tell me right now,
are you in danger?

30
00:03:41,408 --> 00:03:42,720
You know what?

31
00:03:42,752 --> 00:03:46,176
Let's just say that I have
a hell of a lot more

32
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:49,280
on my mind right now

33
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,096
than thinking about buying
a damn car wash.

34
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:53,280
Okay.

35
00:03:53,312 --> 00:03:56,960
So if you could just please...

36
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,824
Okay. Then we go
to the police.

37
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:08,256
What?

38
00:04:08,288 --> 00:04:09,696
We... We tell them
everything...

39
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:13,312
That you're a drug dealer
afraid for your safety,

40
00:04:13,344 --> 00:04:15,488
and... And the safety of
your family... Whoa. Whoa.

41
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,512
And you need...
You need help.

42
00:04:16,544 --> 00:04:17,664
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

43
00:04:17,696 --> 00:04:18,752
What choice is there, Walt?

44
00:04:18,784 --> 00:04:19,776
What choice?

45
00:04:19,808 --> 00:04:20,992
If you're in danger...

46
00:04:21,024 --> 00:04:22,304
Then it would be
absolutely...

47
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:24,224
Stop, stop, stop.

48
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:26,336
You keep saying
that word, danger...

49
00:04:26,368 --> 00:04:28,224
- Danger.
- But you just said...

50
00:04:28,256 --> 00:04:29,824
No, and I have never
used that word.

51
00:04:29,856 --> 00:04:31,648
I said things were complicated,

52
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,312
and then you flew
off the handle.

53
00:04:33,344 --> 00:04:37,248
Yeah, I flew off the handle
when I saw that, okay?

54
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,976
Where'd that come from?
Hmm?

55
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:40,896
A fall in the shower?

56
00:04:40,928 --> 00:04:45,984
Uh, this is just so
passive-aggressive, you know? I...

57
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:48,064
Passive-aggressive?
Are y...

58
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:49,344
I go two days

59
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:51,072
without returning
your phone calls, two days,

60
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:54,400
and I have one minor
little incident,

61
00:04:54,432 --> 00:04:55,968
and now
you're telling me to...

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,400
I should turn myself in
to the police, for God's sake.

63
00:04:58,432 --> 00:04:59,776
- A minor little incident?
- Yes.

64
00:04:59,808 --> 00:05:02,912
What minor little incident?

65
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:07,488
I had an argument
with a co-worker.

66
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,088
Okay?

67
00:05:10,496 --> 00:05:11,840
And?

68
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:13,888
I had an argument.

69
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,872
We were in this bar,

70
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:17,440
and we were discussing

71
00:05:17,472 --> 00:05:19,200
a particular business strategy,

72
00:05:19,232 --> 00:05:23,200
and... And it got heated
and out of control,

73
00:05:23,232 --> 00:05:25,216
and he hit me... Once.

74
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,672
And I didn't retaliate
because he's a much older man.

75
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:31,104
And that's it.

76
00:05:33,472 --> 00:05:36,224
You were in a bar fight?

77
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,968
Yes, Skyler,
I was in a bar fight.

78
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:46,976
So you're okay?

79
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:50,464
Really?

80
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,792
Yes. I'm okay.

81
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:01,248
And I think in the end

82
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,488
it may have been
a good thing, actually,

83
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,504
because we were able
to clear the air

84
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:08,128
and, you know, mutual respect.

85
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:10,720
So...

86
00:06:12,352 --> 00:06:14,304
Frozen peas.

87
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:17,760
What?

88
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,360
It's the best thing
for the swelling.

89
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:22,240
Oh, it... It...
It's not really swollen.

90
00:06:22,272 --> 00:06:23,232
It's...

91
00:06:23,264 --> 00:06:24,288
No peas.

92
00:06:25,728 --> 00:06:26,976
You don't even have ice.

93
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:29,536
I will get peas.
I will get ice.

94
00:06:29,568 --> 00:06:31,520
Peas and ice.
I'm writing it down.

95
00:06:33,152 --> 00:06:34,368
I, uh...

96
00:06:36,608 --> 00:06:39,392
I need you to...

97
00:06:39,424 --> 00:06:44,512
Promise me that if things
do get dangerous...

98
00:06:44,544 --> 00:06:46,752
promise me.

99
00:06:46,784 --> 00:06:48,608
Absolutely.

100
00:06:51,424 --> 00:06:52,512
So...

101
00:06:54,368 --> 00:06:55,840
Car wash.

102
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,768
Charles?

103
00:07:21,344 --> 00:07:24,544
Hi, there. Can I
answer any questions?

104
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:25,952
Yes.

105
00:07:25,984 --> 00:07:27,520
Any chance
of a top-off?

106
00:07:27,552 --> 00:07:30,432
Oh, I think we can
help you out there.

107
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:40,544
So what do you think?

108
00:07:40,576 --> 00:07:43,936
Oh. Very nice. Very open.

109
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:46,240
Oh. I agree. It flows.

110
00:07:46,272 --> 00:07:48,256
A whole lot of natural light.

111
00:07:48,288 --> 00:07:50,048
Uh, Michael Kilbourne.

112
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,744
Tori Costner.

113
00:07:51,776 --> 00:07:52,992
It's nice to meet you.

114
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:55,296
Well, three bedrooms,
one and a half baths,

115
00:07:55,328 --> 00:07:56,864
on just under half an acre.

116
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:59,808
That's a non-attached
casita out in back,

117
00:07:59,872 --> 00:08:03,168
permit usable as office
or guest suite.

118
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,160
Hmm.

119
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,440
Plank wood floors.

120
00:08:05,472 --> 00:08:06,752
Central heat and air.

121
00:08:06,784 --> 00:08:09,056
I...
I see you're married.

122
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,192
No. Divorced, very recent.

123
00:08:12,256 --> 00:08:13,536
Old habits.

124
00:08:13,568 --> 00:08:14,528
Oh. I'm sorry.

125
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,000
Any children?

126
00:08:16,032 --> 00:08:18,752
Yes. As a matter of fact,
a little boy.

127
00:08:18,784 --> 00:08:19,808
Oh. How old?

128
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,280
Uh, he turned 4 in may.

129
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:23,232
He's a gemini.
Would love this yard.

130
00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:25,536
Oh, well, plenty of space
for a jungle gym,

131
00:08:25,568 --> 00:08:28,416
and the neighborhood
preschool is fantastic.

132
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:30,976
Oh, well, I think Eli
is going to be home-schooled.

133
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:32,064
Oh, well, great.

134
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:33,632
Not for religious reasons
or anything.

135
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:34,912
I just want to make sure

136
00:08:34,944 --> 00:08:36,256
that he's getting
enough attention.

137
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:37,824
He'll still go
to summer camp and whatnot,

138
00:08:37,856 --> 00:08:38,976
you know, play dates.

139
00:08:39,008 --> 00:08:40,704
I don't want him to be
socially awkward.

140
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:42,464
Oh, no.
Makes a lot of sense.

141
00:08:42,496 --> 00:08:44,288
He tests very highly...

142
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,760
96 percentile...

143
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,232
But that whole
right brain, left brain...

144
00:08:47,264 --> 00:08:51,232
You want those in balance.

145
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:56,224
You said the casita
has plumbing?

146
00:08:56,256 --> 00:08:57,664
I will go out with Clay,

147
00:08:57,696 --> 00:09:00,256
so I need access
to running water.

148
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:02,784
Well, it's pipe fitted
for a quarter bath,

149
00:09:02,816 --> 00:09:05,184
so make a perfect studio.

150
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:06,400
Hmm.

151
00:09:08,512 --> 00:09:10,336
This could work.

152
00:09:12,576 --> 00:09:14,144
<i>Hell, that's the doctor's plan</i>

153
00:09:14,176 --> 00:09:15,392
<i>to get her patients at ease,</i>

154
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:18,144
<i>if you know what I mean.</i>

155
00:09:18,176 --> 00:09:19,776
<i>But, nurse, I'm not one...</i>

156
00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:21,856
Hello! I'm back!

157
00:09:23,552 --> 00:09:24,512
Hank?

158
00:09:24,544 --> 00:09:25,536
Yeah.

159
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:33,440
Ohh.

160
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:36,288
I had to go
to three different places

161
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,760
to get the moisturizer
that you like,

162
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:38,976
but I got that,

163
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,072
and I got your Shiner Bock
and your chips,

164
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:45,504
and I couldn't resist.

165
00:09:47,968 --> 00:09:51,744
<i>The complete encyclopedia
to fantasy football.</i>

166
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:53,312
Look, it has
all the latest rankings.

167
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:56,416
Marie, I said Cheetos,
not Fritos.

168
00:09:56,448 --> 00:09:58,656
W-wait. Uh...

169
00:09:58,688 --> 00:10:01,088
I must have said Cheetos,
like, ten times.

170
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,912
You need me to write it
down for you?

171
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:04,192
No, and I don't need you

172
00:10:04,224 --> 00:10:05,920
to be mean about it,
either, Mr. grumpy.

173
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:07,200
Well, I'm just saying,
you know.

174
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,600
I said Cheetos.
Ch-ch-ch sound,

175
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:13,056
virtually impossible to
confuse Cheetos with Fritos,

176
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:14,048
it seems to me.

177
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,200
Where are you going?

178
00:10:15,232 --> 00:10:17,600
Uh, back to the store, I guess.

179
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:20,224
Here.

180
00:10:21,312 --> 00:10:22,720
And the draft's
not for two months,

181
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:24,128
so this is useless.

182
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,296
Can you believe it?

183
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:42,816
What?

184
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,208
What? This.

185
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:53,664
Well, you always thought
this place could be bugged.

186
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:54,912
Now we know.

187
00:10:54,944 --> 00:10:58,144
Yeah, well, I don't like it.

188
00:10:58,176 --> 00:11:00,256
It's a violation
of the work space.

189
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:03,552
Yeah, I guess.

190
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,432
Want to do something?

191
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,136
Do something?
Like what?

192
00:11:13,184 --> 00:11:15,328
Go-karts?

193
00:11:17,472 --> 00:11:19,264
Go-karts? What...

194
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:24,448
Yeah, there's a track
down by the Coliseum.

195
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,240
It's pretty fun.

196
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,232
No.

197
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:34,720
Actually, I have...

198
00:11:34,752 --> 00:11:37,664
I have a meeting, so...

199
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,072
All right. Whatever.

200
00:11:43,424 --> 00:11:44,704
Rain check?

201
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:46,720
Yeah, sure.

202
00:11:53,056 --> 00:11:55,072
How you doing?

203
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,760
Good.

204
00:11:57,792 --> 00:11:58,784
Yeah?

205
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,664
You okay?

206
00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:07,936
Is there, uh, anything
we should talk about?

207
00:12:13,088 --> 00:12:14,624
How's your eye?

208
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,872
Yeah, it's fine.

209
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:23,936
Anything we should talk about?

210
00:12:31,392 --> 00:12:32,992
For what it's worth...

211
00:12:34,112 --> 00:12:36,320
Getting the shit
kicked out of you...

212
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,472
Not to say you, uh,
you get used to it, but...

213
00:12:42,592 --> 00:12:44,896
You do kind of get used to it.

214
00:12:58,432 --> 00:13:00,832
Two words... Nail salon.

215
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:03,264
It's perfect
for money laundering.

216
00:13:03,296 --> 00:13:05,344
It's a high volume
cash-preferred business

217
00:13:05,376 --> 00:13:06,720
with a discreet work force.

218
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:09,696
I mean, nobody does
"mister, me know nothing"

219
00:13:09,728 --> 00:13:11,968
better than Mrs.
Mookjaiaporn and her gals.

220
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,568
Mr. Goodman...

221
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,744
Saul, please. Now,

222
00:13:15,776 --> 00:13:17,312
for the lady
of the house...

223
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:19,008
Drum roll, please...

224
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,288
how about a lifetime supply

225
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,208
of French manicures
and enzyme peels?

226
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,840
Ah, yeah. Go ahead,
pinch yourself.

227
00:13:23,872 --> 00:13:24,992
Ha ha ha!

228
00:13:25,024 --> 00:13:27,712
We're not buying
a nail salon, Mr. Goodman.

229
00:13:27,744 --> 00:13:29,504
We're getting the car wash.

230
00:13:29,536 --> 00:13:31,712
I'm sorry. Am I missing
something here?

231
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,792
I mean, didn't you
already try that?

232
00:13:33,824 --> 00:13:36,160
Yeah. I mean,
Walt told me

233
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:38,944
that you, uh, took a run
at this Bogdan character,

234
00:13:38,976 --> 00:13:40,576
and he wrestled you
into submission

235
00:13:40,608 --> 00:13:41,696
with his eyebrows.

236
00:13:41,728 --> 00:13:44,640
10 million, that was the
asking price, right?

237
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:47,040
Apparently, he upped it to 20.

238
00:13:47,072 --> 00:13:48,960
Ha ho! Nice negotiating.

239
00:13:48,992 --> 00:13:52,064
Yeah. I... Hey, you bombed.
It happens.

240
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:54,208
You were smart to call me.

241
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,472
Now... Uh,
you just sit back, relax,

242
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,552
and let a professional
take over.

243
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:00,576
Who is that?

244
00:14:00,608 --> 00:14:02,752
That's for me. Excuse me.

245
00:14:07,104 --> 00:14:08,832
What do you want?
I'm in a meeting.

246
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:11,488
Why didn't you
think of that before?

247
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,736
It's not my...

248
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,528
I'm in a meeting.

249
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,360
Can Huell use your bathroom?

250
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,592
Huell?

251
00:14:22,624 --> 00:14:25,824
Uh, sure.
The top of the stairs.

252
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:27,232
He'll be quick.

253
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:32,384
It's a stomach thing.

254
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,688
So where were we?

255
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,024
Professionalism.

256
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:40,416
Yeah. Um, so the guy
won't sell, he won't sell.

257
00:14:40,448 --> 00:14:41,984
I don't accept that.

258
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:43,776
I don't accept
that he won't sell.

259
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:46,208
I... I think he just
lacks the proper...

260
00:14:47,456 --> 00:14:48,832
Motivation.

261
00:14:48,896 --> 00:14:51,200
Motivation. Oh. Uh,

262
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:56,032
as in "motivation" motivation?

263
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:57,760
I mean, just so we're
on the same page here.

264
00:14:57,792 --> 00:15:00,640
You're saying we make him
an offer he can't refuse?

265
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:03,296
Nothing so dramatic
as that, no.

266
00:15:03,328 --> 00:15:04,896
Motivation.

267
00:15:07,552 --> 00:15:09,632
Attitude adjustment.

268
00:15:09,664 --> 00:15:12,192
Ho ho ho ho!

269
00:15:12,224 --> 00:15:15,488
This one, she's a keeper.

270
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,080
Well, an audit can be
highly motivating.

271
00:15:18,112 --> 00:15:19,936
I know a gal
over at tax and revenue.

272
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,120
You give her ten minutes

273
00:15:21,152 --> 00:15:22,272
on this Bogdan fella's books,

274
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:23,904
she'll have his sky
raining frogs.

275
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:27,744
No, we don't want to draw
any unwanted tax attention.

276
00:15:27,776 --> 00:15:29,504
We don't want them
looking at us

277
00:15:29,536 --> 00:15:30,784
after Bogdan sells.

278
00:15:30,816 --> 00:15:33,856
All right. How about
an I.C.E. raid?

279
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:35,808
You know he's got illegals
working over there.

280
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,312
I mean, he just has to.

281
00:15:37,344 --> 00:15:40,448
We are not getting a bunch of poor
innocent people in trouble, no.

282
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,624
Yeah. And also, you're
going to need them

283
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:44,352
after you take over.
Tck.

284
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:47,968
Hey. How about terrorism?

285
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:51,296
"Oh, agent Hoover,
I got to tell you,

286
00:15:51,328 --> 00:15:54,144
"I've seen some real
islamic comings and goings

287
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:55,552
over there at the car wash."

288
00:15:55,584 --> 00:15:58,048
Yeah, I mean guys in turbans
pulling up in vans

289
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,128
and stuff like that. Ha ha!

290
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,328
Saul, Bogdan is Romanian.

291
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,776
Okay, well, we're... We're
just spitballing here, so...

292
00:16:07,808 --> 00:16:10,880
Okay, there's always...

293
00:16:12,032 --> 00:16:15,168
"You got
a real nice place here.

294
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,640
A shame if something
happened to it."

295
00:16:16,672 --> 00:16:18,048
That angle.

296
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,344
What are you talking about?

297
00:16:21,376 --> 00:16:23,232
Violence?

298
00:16:25,376 --> 00:16:26,912
Attitude adjustment.

299
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,288
Oh, no. That? No.

300
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,952
That is not at all
what I meant.

301
00:16:29,984 --> 00:16:31,648
I... We do not do that.

302
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,152
That's not who we are,

303
00:16:33,184 --> 00:16:34,272
right?

304
00:16:34,304 --> 00:16:36,256
Yeah. No. No.

305
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,272
No, she... She's right.

306
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:41,664
Look, do I need
to state the obvious?

307
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:43,200
I mean, there's got to be

308
00:16:43,232 --> 00:16:46,816
dozens of car washes
in this area.

309
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:48,864
Who says it has to be this one?

310
00:16:48,896 --> 00:16:51,040
I do.

311
00:16:51,072 --> 00:16:52,960
I say it has to.

312
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:54,080
Why?

313
00:16:56,128 --> 00:16:57,376
I just do.

314
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,416
God.

315
00:17:01,632 --> 00:17:03,104
Well, that clears things up.

316
00:17:04,384 --> 00:17:06,720
I don't like him...
Bogdan.

317
00:17:06,752 --> 00:17:09,184
He was condescending
to me, rude about you,

318
00:17:09,248 --> 00:17:11,296
and I do not like him.

319
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:12,800
Simple as that.

320
00:17:14,048 --> 00:17:17,504
Hey, nobody appreciates
a passionate woman

321
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,040
more than I do,

322
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,696
but, uh, in this business,

323
00:17:21,728 --> 00:17:23,520
and Walt can
back me up on this,

324
00:17:23,552 --> 00:17:25,376
the number 1 rule is...

325
00:17:25,408 --> 00:17:27,040
Don't take things personally.

326
00:17:27,072 --> 00:17:30,528
What do you... What do you
mean, rude about me?

327
00:17:34,624 --> 00:17:38,272
Something along the lines of...

328
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:41,888
You weren't man enough
to face him yourself.

329
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,264
What?

330
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,664
That you had to send your woman

331
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:47,488
to do your business for you.

332
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,424
Okay, uh, speaking
as your lawyer,

333
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:52,672
I'm going to go on record

334
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,144
and say this is a bad idea.

335
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:55,200
Now, I advise against...

336
00:17:55,232 --> 00:17:56,448
It's this one.

337
00:18:03,872 --> 00:18:05,760
Okay. So, uh...

338
00:18:07,552 --> 00:18:08,768
All we have to do

339
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,168
is think of a nonviolent,

340
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,176
unsuspicious way
to purchase the car wash

341
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,320
that... That...
That protects the innocent

342
00:18:16,384 --> 00:18:20,064
and doesn't cost $20 million.

343
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:24,768
Don't everybody speak at once.

344
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,336
Hi.

345
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:44,608
Can I answer any questions?

346
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,080
Oh. Spoons.

347
00:18:46,112 --> 00:18:48,672
Yes. The owner
is quite the collector.

348
00:18:48,704 --> 00:18:49,824
Aren't they something?

349
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:51,776
One for each of the 50 states.

350
00:18:51,808 --> 00:18:54,976
Uh, Puerto Rico is
technically a territory.

351
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,184
Huh.

352
00:18:57,216 --> 00:18:59,872
You know, maybe they
were thinking...

353
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:02,048
Some day.

354
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,440
Uh, so no basement.

355
00:19:05,472 --> 00:19:07,072
No basement. Sorry.

356
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,824
That's a problem.
My brother's in the peace corps,

357
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:11,296
and won't be back
for 18 months,

358
00:19:11,328 --> 00:19:14,400
and I said I'd hang
on to his furniture.

359
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:16,096
Well, if you're looking
for storage space,

360
00:19:16,128 --> 00:19:17,696
there's an attic area
that's sizeable.

361
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:21,632
Oh. Huh. Well, an attic
might be even better,

362
00:19:21,664 --> 00:19:22,784
as long as it's dry.

363
00:19:22,816 --> 00:19:24,224
- Let's take a tour.
- Okay.

364
00:19:24,256 --> 00:19:26,880
Actually, I have
a handout for you.

365
00:19:32,608 --> 00:19:34,464
It has all the information.

366
00:19:34,528 --> 00:19:36,224
I'm Stephanie Doswell,
by the way.

367
00:19:36,256 --> 00:19:37,856
Charlotte Blattner.

368
00:19:37,888 --> 00:19:39,104
So nice to meet you, Charlotte.

369
00:19:39,168 --> 00:19:40,512
You, too.

370
00:19:40,544 --> 00:19:42,144
So I just told him
point-blank...

371
00:19:42,176 --> 00:19:44,416
"You're my husband,
and I love you.

372
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:46,784
"But you're 53 years old.

373
00:19:46,816 --> 00:19:50,240
"This job has just
gotten too stressful"

374
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,024
and difficult,
and it's time to quit.

375
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:56,352
And, miracle of miracles,
he listened.

376
00:19:56,384 --> 00:19:58,144
Still, what
a fascinating career

377
00:19:58,176 --> 00:19:59,744
that must have been for him.

378
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:02,016
It was. I mean,

379
00:20:02,048 --> 00:20:04,736
NASA was like
a second family to us,

380
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:07,392
but, you know,

381
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:09,152
it was time
for a new adventure,

382
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:11,936
so, between his pension

383
00:20:11,968 --> 00:20:14,176
and the income I bring in
from hand modeling,

384
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,416
we're, you know, comfortable.

385
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,624
Uh, when were these
floors redone?

386
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:19,872
Two years ago,

387
00:20:19,904 --> 00:20:21,312
and the counters are brand new.

388
00:20:21,376 --> 00:20:23,232
I can tell. Travertine.

389
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,024
Hmm.
Nice.

390
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:26,528
Any children?

391
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,032
No.

392
00:20:28,064 --> 00:20:31,200
I don't really want kids.

393
00:20:31,232 --> 00:20:33,536
Is that horrible for me
to say, do you think?

394
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:36,032
Not at all. Not everyone
has to have children.

395
00:20:36,064 --> 00:20:38,816
Hmm. You should
talk to my husband.

396
00:20:38,848 --> 00:20:41,280
Uh, garbage disposal?

397
00:20:41,312 --> 00:20:42,464
Mm-hmm.

398
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,928
Aah!

399
00:21:54,336 --> 00:21:55,296
Check it out.

400
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,640
Score, yo.

401
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:10,816
I really love your home.

402
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,032
Well, thank you, Mimi.

403
00:23:12,064 --> 00:23:16,032
It has a...
Very European feel.

404
00:23:16,064 --> 00:23:17,120
You think?

405
00:23:17,152 --> 00:23:18,720
Oh, I lived in London
for years,

406
00:23:18,752 --> 00:23:21,504
so yeah, this feels familiar.

407
00:23:21,536 --> 00:23:22,944
Where in London?

408
00:23:22,976 --> 00:23:26,016
I was stationed at Upwood
in the '60s.

409
00:23:26,048 --> 00:23:26,944
Right downtown.

410
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,480
But we were almost never there.

411
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,816
My husband is an illustrator,
so we traveled a lot...

412
00:23:30,848 --> 00:23:32,512
Paris, Italy, Denmark.

413
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,176
It was before the kids
were in school,

414
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,000
so it was easy
to pick up and go.

415
00:23:36,032 --> 00:23:37,824
That was before
my youngest, Lucy,

416
00:23:37,856 --> 00:23:39,744
was diagnosed
with endocarditis.

417
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,248
Oh, my.

418
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,656
Gosh, is that, uh...

419
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:45,024
It's a bacterial infection
of the heart valves.

420
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:47,392
It's... Yeah, it can be...

421
00:23:47,424 --> 00:23:49,696
Mmm. That's terrible.

422
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,424
Is she all right?

423
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,720
Your daughter.

424
00:23:54,752 --> 00:23:56,320
Is she okay?

425
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,432
Yes. Th-thank you.

426
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:01,440
Um, the doctor's put her
on a prosthetic valve,

427
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:03,168
so she's... Lucy's fine.

428
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,176
Running and walking,
riding horses.

429
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:07,648
Well, thank goodness.

430
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,008
Yeah. We're...Very lucky.

431
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,224
Yeah.

432
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:18,944
Excuse me. Miss?

433
00:24:18,976 --> 00:24:20,768
Very nice. Thank you!

434
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,624
I just called the police.

435
00:24:22,656 --> 00:24:23,680
Okay, then.

436
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,888
I know you stole that spoon.

437
00:24:25,952 --> 00:24:28,864
What spoon? What are you
talking about?

438
00:24:28,896 --> 00:24:29,984
You're a thief.

439
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,832
Excuse me?

440
00:24:32,864 --> 00:24:33,760
And a liar,

441
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,072
making stories up
about yourself.

442
00:24:35,104 --> 00:24:36,256
What's wrong with you?

443
00:24:36,288 --> 00:24:38,016
No. What's the matter
with you, lady?

444
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:41,120
You better just back off, okay?

445
00:24:41,152 --> 00:24:43,936
My husband is a DEA agent.

446
00:24:43,968 --> 00:24:46,432
I thought he was an astronaut
or an illustrator.

447
00:24:46,464 --> 00:24:48,192
You better get your
crazy lies straight.

448
00:24:48,224 --> 00:24:49,504
You know what, fatty?

449
00:24:49,536 --> 00:24:53,056
You are so lucky that I
am late for an appointment.

450
00:24:53,088 --> 00:24:54,272
You're not going anywhere.

451
00:24:54,304 --> 00:24:55,264
Hey, my purse.

452
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,736
Not until the police get here.

453
00:24:56,768 --> 00:24:59,040
Let go of it! Let it go!

454
00:24:59,072 --> 00:25:00,288
Let it go!

455
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,696
Let it...Go!

456
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,056
You are in big trouble.

457
00:25:23,168 --> 00:25:24,224
Yeah.

458
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

459
00:25:29,792 --> 00:25:30,816
Just sl...

460
00:25:30,848 --> 00:25:32,416
Slow down. Start from the...

461
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:33,440
You...

462
00:25:34,592 --> 00:25:35,776
You're where?

463
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,248
Why the f...

464
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,496
Why are you...

465
00:25:49,376 --> 00:25:54,112
Are you seriously
doing this to me again?

466
00:25:58,688 --> 00:26:00,512
Jesus, just st...

467
00:26:05,536 --> 00:26:07,296
Would you stop crying?

468
00:26:14,496 --> 00:26:17,344
I'll make a phone call.
Just sit tight.

469
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,816
Where do they got you?

470
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,080
So good news. The officer
spoke to the homeowners,

471
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,616
and they're not
going to press charges.

472
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,760
Good. I won't, either.

473
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:41,280
Okay, then,
so we're good to go.

474
00:26:43,296 --> 00:26:44,576
You ready?

475
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,336
Marie, you want to go home?

476
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,704
Marie?

477
00:28:03,104 --> 00:28:04,704
Yes, it's Skyler White

478
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,528
calling for Saul Goodman,
please.

479
00:28:07,584 --> 00:28:09,216
Yes, it is important.

480
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,784
Thank you.

481
00:28:24,576 --> 00:28:27,104
Sorry. Same as before.

482
00:28:27,136 --> 00:28:29,088
But this is not right.

483
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,744
You cannot shut me down.
You cannot do this.

484
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:33,376
Mr. Wolynetz, I've checked
your waste water

485
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,560
inside and out.

486
00:28:34,592 --> 00:28:35,968
I've checked
your runoff gutters,

487
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,528
and now out here
more contaminants...

488
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,480
Ammonia, acetone,

489
00:28:40,544 --> 00:28:42,400
benzene, nitrobenzene.

490
00:28:42,432 --> 00:28:44,416
No, no, no.
This is a mistake.

491
00:28:44,448 --> 00:28:46,240
Where is Gary?
He will tell you

492
00:28:46,272 --> 00:28:48,287
my soap is very good,
very green.

493
00:28:48,288 --> 00:28:49,664
No, your soap is not the issue.

494
00:28:49,696 --> 00:28:51,168
It's your filtration system.

495
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,600
At the very least,
you'll need to retrofit.

496
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,096
But if you're leeching
into the ground water,

497
00:28:56,128 --> 00:28:59,008
which is looking like
a real possibility here,

498
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,504
you're going to need to
replace your system entirely.

499
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,416
Replace? Do you know
how much cost that is?

500
00:29:04,448 --> 00:29:05,856
$200,000.

501
00:29:05,888 --> 00:29:07,712
Look, I understand
it's a hardship.

502
00:29:07,744 --> 00:29:10,848
If you like, we can give you
a list of approved vendors.

503
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,544
If you get going immediately,

504
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,984
your down time
shouldn't be any more

505
00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:15,136
than four or five weeks.

506
00:29:15,168 --> 00:29:17,792
Okay. So sorry. You're right.

507
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:21,216
From now on,
we will be extra careful

508
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:23,552
and, uh, clean.

509
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,992
No more pollution, okay?

510
00:29:25,024 --> 00:29:26,592
- Yes?
- No, I'm sorry.

511
00:29:26,624 --> 00:29:28,032
The state requires you

512
00:29:28,096 --> 00:29:29,888
to suspend
all commercial activity

513
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,384
until these levels reach
the mandated minimums.

514
00:29:33,632 --> 00:29:35,200
Where is usual man?
Where is Gary?

515
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,088
He got transferred
to Las Cruces.

516
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,232
If you'd like to file an
appeal, you can contact...

517
00:29:39,264 --> 00:29:41,152
I have done nothing wrong.

518
00:29:41,184 --> 00:29:43,136
Tell me, why you shut me down?

519
00:29:43,168 --> 00:29:44,544
What laws did I break?

520
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,600
What laws? Several.

521
00:29:45,632 --> 00:29:48,192
Tell me exact specific laws,
or I refuse.

522
00:29:48,224 --> 00:29:49,248
- Specific?
- Right now.

523
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,592
The...

524
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:51,808
Tell me exact...

525
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,928
- The specific laws...
- What laws?

526
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,984
<i>Hold on, okay?</i>

527
00:29:54,016 --> 00:29:54,976
<i>Hold on. Hold on.</i>

528
00:29:55,008 --> 00:29:56,032
Wait, wait, wait.

529
00:29:56,064 --> 00:29:57,600
Okay. Okay.

530
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,992
The New Mexico
hazardous waste act of 1978,

531
00:30:01,024 --> 00:30:03,264
section 74, chapter 4,

532
00:30:03,296 --> 00:30:06,976
part 13 states, "whenever
the disposal of solid waste

533
00:30:07,008 --> 00:30:08,544
or hazardous waste presents..."

534
00:30:08,576 --> 00:30:10,816
An imminent
or substantial endangerment,

535
00:30:10,848 --> 00:30:14,816
the offender may be fined
not more than $5,000

536
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:16,544
each day in which
the violation occurs.

537
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,048
All right. Okay.

538
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,896
Now the...

539
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,456
Okay. Okay, baby.

540
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:28,160
All right.
The EPA can cite him

541
00:30:28,192 --> 00:30:30,784
under the toxic
substances...

542
00:30:30,816 --> 00:30:33,024
Control act of 1976,

543
00:30:33,056 --> 00:30:35,008
U.S. code title 15,

544
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,256
chapter 53...

545
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,440
Subchapter 1...

546
00:30:37,472 --> 00:30:39,936
Section 2606.

547
00:30:41,248 --> 00:30:42,560
Satisfied?

548
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:46,016
Was that specific...

549
00:30:46,048 --> 00:30:47,296
Enough for you?

550
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,967
All done with lunch?

551
00:31:07,968 --> 00:31:09,024
Hmm.

552
00:31:11,072 --> 00:31:13,376
You hardly touched this.

553
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,072
I'm not hungry.

554
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:17,440
Well...

555
00:31:18,848 --> 00:31:20,640
I'm leaving the rice pudding.

556
00:31:21,728 --> 00:31:23,296
I'm not hungry, Marie.

557
00:31:23,328 --> 00:31:24,704
So don't eat it.

558
00:31:49,088 --> 00:31:50,880
Hey, Marie.
How you doing?

559
00:31:50,912 --> 00:31:54,016
I... I'm okay.
Is there a problem?

560
00:31:54,048 --> 00:31:56,320
No, no.
Everything's fine.

561
00:31:56,352 --> 00:31:58,240
I'm here for Hank, actually.

562
00:31:58,272 --> 00:32:00,800
Oh. You're so sweet.

563
00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:02,432
Hank will be thrilled.

564
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,672
Sweetie, you have a visitor.

565
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:21,344
Ah, Jesus.
What now?

566
00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:22,592
She rob a bank?

567
00:32:22,624 --> 00:32:24,352
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?

568
00:32:24,384 --> 00:32:27,904
Oh, well,

569
00:32:27,936 --> 00:32:29,216
can't complain, you know.

570
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:30,496
Every day a little better.

571
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:32,736
That's good.
You're looking good.

572
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,680
Yeah, well, handsome
was never the hard part.

573
00:32:36,672 --> 00:32:38,656
Come on in.
Grab a seat.

574
00:32:39,744 --> 00:32:41,984
Yeah, just throw
that stuff anywhere.

575
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,720
Listen, uh...

576
00:32:46,752 --> 00:32:49,248
Thanks again for the other day.

577
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,072
You know, this...
This whole thing,

578
00:32:51,104 --> 00:32:54,400
it's, uh,
it's been hard on her.

579
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:56,896
Forget it. Glad to help.

580
00:32:58,784 --> 00:33:01,664
So, rock collecting?

581
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,968
They're minerals. Yeah.

582
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,816
Uh, it's cataloging them...

583
00:33:06,848 --> 00:33:08,608
Sort them, label them.

584
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,296
Um, it's actually
a lot of work.

585
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,144
Yeah?
No, it looks like it.

586
00:33:16,096 --> 00:33:18,304
So, what's up?

587
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:23,072
Well, actually, I could use
your help on something.

588
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:25,440
Homicide,
possibly drug-related.

589
00:33:25,472 --> 00:33:28,064
You want my help on the case?

590
00:33:28,096 --> 00:33:29,824
What am I, Ironside?

591
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,896
No. But you're a drug cop
who knows the local talent,

592
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,976
and you're a pal
I just did a favor for,

593
00:33:35,008 --> 00:33:36,672
so let me pick your brain
a second.

594
00:33:36,704 --> 00:33:37,920
You ever come across a guy

595
00:33:37,984 --> 00:33:39,584
by the name of Gale Boetticher?

596
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,176
No.

597
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:44,832
Someone came along
and shot him in the face.

598
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,072
Okay.

599
00:33:47,104 --> 00:33:49,056
No signs of forced entry,

600
00:33:49,088 --> 00:33:50,656
no signs of robbery.

601
00:33:50,688 --> 00:33:53,344
Okay, so it's
a crime of passion.

602
00:33:53,376 --> 00:33:55,648
Where's the drug angle?

603
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,752
We found a notebook
at his place.

604
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,568
I made a copy for you
in case your interested.

605
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,392
Looks like it pertains

606
00:34:03,424 --> 00:34:06,720
to some kind of
methamphetamine superlab.

607
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:08,032
Ah.

608
00:34:08,064 --> 00:34:10,272
It's filled with
scientific formulas

609
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,608
and chemical purchase lists...

610
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,840
Drawings, pages
and pages of this stuff.

611
00:34:15,872 --> 00:34:18,656
It looks big time,
but I'm no authority,

612
00:34:18,688 --> 00:34:21,088
so I wonder if you
might take a look.

613
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:25,760
Come on, Tim, seriously.

614
00:34:25,792 --> 00:34:28,128
What is this, some kind
of a charity thing?

615
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,008
I thought your expertise
could be useful here.

616
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,240
I'm lying here
like, uh, third base,

617
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,896
living from bowel movement
to bowel movement.

618
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:39,200
I'm not even useful to myself.

619
00:34:40,832 --> 00:34:42,752
Want my advice?

620
00:34:42,784 --> 00:34:45,120
Take this to Steve Gomez.

621
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:46,272
He'll help you out.

622
00:34:46,304 --> 00:34:48,704
I give this to Steve Gomez,

623
00:34:48,736 --> 00:34:50,784
and all of a sudden
it becomes a DEA case.

624
00:34:50,816 --> 00:34:53,088
What good does that do me?

625
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,480
If you could just take a look,

626
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:58,848
tell me what I got here,

627
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,512
I'd really appreciate it.

628
00:35:04,544 --> 00:35:05,824
Eh.

629
00:35:07,776 --> 00:35:09,024
Whatever.

630
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,080
Thanks, man.

631
00:35:15,168 --> 00:35:16,928
You take it easy.

632
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,336
That's what I do.

633
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:03,200
Well, it was a good try.

634
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,592
Here we go.
Time for your nap. Yeah.

635
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,448
Oh, you're good.

636
00:36:18,144 --> 00:36:19,456
So...

637
00:36:21,216 --> 00:36:23,296
Nail salon sounded promising.

638
00:36:23,328 --> 00:36:25,024
What do you think?

639
00:36:25,056 --> 00:36:27,264
I think we wait.

640
00:36:27,296 --> 00:36:28,928
Wait.

641
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,608
Skyler, it has been five hours.

642
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,984
He'll call.

643
00:36:34,016 --> 00:36:35,360
Ahem. Just wait.

644
00:36:35,392 --> 00:36:36,608
Just wait.

645
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,920
Look.

646
00:36:39,968 --> 00:36:42,720
It was a good idea.
It was a great idea.

647
00:36:42,752 --> 00:36:43,904
But it didn't work.

648
00:36:43,936 --> 00:36:45,824
So why don't we
simply chalk it up

649
00:36:45,856 --> 00:36:48,832
as a learning...

650
00:36:54,816 --> 00:36:56,512
White residence.

651
00:36:57,824 --> 00:36:59,744
Oh, hello, Mr. Wolynetz.

652
00:37:00,736 --> 00:37:02,592
Am I still interested?

653
00:37:02,624 --> 00:37:05,216
Well, I...
I think that depends.

654
00:37:05,248 --> 00:37:08,416
Yes, 879
was the original offer,

655
00:37:08,448 --> 00:37:10,752
but that seems high to me now.

656
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,480
Now I'm offering 800.

657
00:37:12,512 --> 00:37:13,856
No, no, no. No, no.
Don't do that.

658
00:37:13,888 --> 00:37:15,488
- Why?
- Don't do that.

659
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,664
Well, because you're
an unpleasant person,

660
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,424
Mr. Wolynetz.
You were rude to me

661
00:37:19,456 --> 00:37:20,896
and disrespectful
towards my husband.

662
00:37:20,928 --> 00:37:22,336
- Skyler...
- And furthermore,

663
00:37:22,368 --> 00:37:24,544
I've met with quite
a number of sellers,

664
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,848
and the market seems
much softer than I thought.

665
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,896
So 800.

666
00:37:28,928 --> 00:37:30,720
<i>You are talking crazy.
800?</i>

667
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,968
Uh-huh.

668
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,080
<i>You are a very,
very crazy lady.</i>

669
00:37:34,112 --> 00:37:36,384
Well, I understand
that you're disappointed,

670
00:37:36,416 --> 00:37:38,176
but that is my final offer.

671
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:40,928
I'm sorry we couldn't
make it work.

672
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,984
Goodbye.

673
00:37:43,328 --> 00:37:45,984
What are you doing?

674
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:47,904
I'm negotiating.

675
00:37:47,936 --> 00:37:49,920
Why?

676
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,488
Because I want to pay less.

677
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,768
Oh, now...

678
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,904
$79,000 less?

679
00:37:55,936 --> 00:37:58,368
Who cares? Do you know
how much I make in a day?

680
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,512
Yeah, but that's
the very reason

681
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:01,728
we need to negotiate.

682
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,232
We don't want
to arouse suspicion

683
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,896
by not trying
to get a good deal.

684
00:38:04,928 --> 00:38:07,360
Look, I get the logic.
I do.

685
00:38:07,424 --> 00:38:10,016
But you just went
too far with it.

686
00:38:10,048 --> 00:38:11,520
You're calling him names?

687
00:38:11,552 --> 00:38:13,152
I didn't call him names.
Ohh.

688
00:38:13,184 --> 00:38:14,528
I said he was unpleasant.

689
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,152
Ohh...

690
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,120
Well,
he's not calling you back.

691
00:38:21,152 --> 00:38:25,504
I mean, you didn't honestly
think that worked.

692
00:38:26,784 --> 00:38:29,280
Yeah, I do.

693
00:38:29,344 --> 00:38:30,592
Oh.

694
00:38:30,624 --> 00:38:32,576
No way. Sorry. No.

695
00:38:32,608 --> 00:38:34,176
- So...
- Ahem.

696
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:36,576
It's time to move on, okay?

697
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:38,496
I'm going to call Saul.

698
00:38:38,528 --> 00:38:40,512
Where's my phone?

699
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:01,248
Wait.

700
00:39:01,312 --> 00:39:02,272
No.

701
00:39:02,304 --> 00:39:03,712
- What?
- No, just...

702
00:39:03,744 --> 00:39:04,736
- Wait, wait.
- What for?

703
00:39:04,768 --> 00:39:05,760
Wait, wait.

704
00:39:05,792 --> 00:39:06,848
For...

705
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,872
Oh, my God.

706
00:39:13,472 --> 00:39:14,976
Hello.

707
00:39:16,704 --> 00:39:18,432
Hello, Mr. Wolynetz.

708
00:39:18,464 --> 00:39:20,416
No one's
really paying attention

709
00:39:20,448 --> 00:39:21,600
to where these things are.

710
00:39:21,632 --> 00:39:23,456
I mean, there's got to be
thousands of them

711
00:39:23,488 --> 00:39:24,320
all over the world

712
00:39:24,352 --> 00:39:26,336
and on boats
coming right for us.

713
00:39:26,368 --> 00:39:28,704
And put on inside
an ice cream truck,

714
00:39:28,736 --> 00:39:30,496
drive it into San Francisco.

715
00:39:30,528 --> 00:39:32,224
I'm not even that scared

716
00:39:32,256 --> 00:39:33,632
of burning up in cannibalism.

717
00:39:33,664 --> 00:39:35,872
To me the things that...
Thing that worries me

718
00:39:35,904 --> 00:39:37,280
is... Is getting trampled

719
00:39:37,312 --> 00:39:39,808
or... Or shoved up
against a chain link fence

720
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,632
because if you really
think about it,

721
00:39:41,664 --> 00:39:43,328
if you were against
a chain link fence

722
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,024
and you've got a...
A lot...

723
00:39:45,056 --> 00:39:47,776
I mean a lot of people
trying to escape,

724
00:39:47,808 --> 00:39:50,336
pushing hard enough forward.

725
00:39:50,368 --> 00:39:53,088
It's not a joke.
You're going to get squeezed

726
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,272
right through the chain links

727
00:39:54,304 --> 00:39:57,536
like Pla-doh or some
kind of soft meat.

728
00:39:57,568 --> 00:40:00,192
Uh, and this is inevitable,
okay?

729
00:40:00,224 --> 00:40:03,744
And there's nothing you or me
or anyone can do about it.

730
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,952
And if the fence posts
are stuck deep...

731
00:40:05,984 --> 00:40:09,568
Really deep with the cement
way down inside the ground,

732
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,816
then it's definitely
happening to you.

733
00:40:10,848 --> 00:40:14,400
- Blood on the wall.
- Yeah.

734
00:40:14,432 --> 00:40:15,744
Bitch.

735
00:40:15,776 --> 00:40:19,136
Somebody got shot.
Somebody probably got shot.

736
00:40:21,312 --> 00:40:23,456
Like soft meat, man,

737
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:24,512
right through...

738
00:40:24,544 --> 00:40:28,416
Being squeezed through there
like soft meat.

739
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:31,872
Like soft meat,
right through the chain.

740
00:40:31,904 --> 00:40:34,592
Right through the...
Right through the chain.

741
00:40:34,624 --> 00:40:38,016
It's... It's inevitable.
Just...

742
00:40:38,048 --> 00:40:39,200
Hey.

743
00:40:39,232 --> 00:40:40,864
Hey.

744
00:40:42,112 --> 00:40:43,840
Money!

745
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,888
Whoo!

746
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,944
Whoa.

747
00:41:19,008 --> 00:41:20,032
Ohh.

748
00:41:21,536 --> 00:41:24,768
- Ohh, nice.
- Yeah.

749
00:41:30,976 --> 00:41:32,704
To...

750
00:41:32,736 --> 00:41:36,960
Clean cars and clean money.

751
00:41:38,144 --> 00:41:39,168
Hear, hear.

752
00:41:45,696 --> 00:41:46,912
You see?

753
00:41:46,944 --> 00:41:49,024
I told you we'd get it.

754
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,784
Did you?
Mm-hmm.

755
00:41:50,816 --> 00:41:52,192
Wow.

756
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:59,520
Seriously, that was
really great work.

757
00:41:59,552 --> 00:42:01,088
It's impressive.

758
00:42:02,976 --> 00:42:04,224
Thank you.

759
00:42:05,408 --> 00:42:07,296
And Saul finally came through.

760
00:42:07,328 --> 00:42:08,352
Ahem.

761
00:42:08,384 --> 00:42:11,104
Well, I mean,
he found the guy, right?

762
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,080
Well, yes, he found the guy,

763
00:42:14,112 --> 00:42:16,832
but I told him what to do
and what to say.

764
00:42:16,864 --> 00:42:19,872
You're right.
That's the hard part.

765
00:42:21,216 --> 00:42:25,600
But yes, Saul was, uh...
Finally useful.

766
00:42:25,632 --> 00:42:27,968
Throw him a bone.

767
00:42:29,664 --> 00:42:30,976
Mmm.

768
00:42:31,008 --> 00:42:32,544
Oh, my God.

769
00:42:32,576 --> 00:42:35,008
This is truly amazing.

770
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,400
Yes, well, it better be
at $320 a bottle.

771
00:42:38,432 --> 00:42:39,776
What?

772
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:43,168
Cuvée Pol Roget,
Sir Winston Churchill.

773
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,792
Apparently, it was
his favorite champagne,

774
00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:48,064
so they just named it
after him.

775
00:42:48,096 --> 00:42:49,856
How did you pay for it?

776
00:42:49,888 --> 00:42:51,584
What do you mean?

777
00:42:51,648 --> 00:42:55,072
Ah. No. Cash.
I paid cash.

778
00:42:55,104 --> 00:42:58,496
No, I'm... I'm asking
how did you, Walter White,

779
00:42:58,528 --> 00:43:00,832
an unemployed schoolteacher,
pay for it?

780
00:43:00,864 --> 00:43:02,240
How do you explain it?

781
00:43:02,272 --> 00:43:05,632
Skyler, no one saw me.

782
00:43:05,664 --> 00:43:08,448
Whoever sold it to you did,
and that's not the point.

783
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,456
The point is we're broke,
remember?

784
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,696
I mean, I'm waiting for your
unemployment check to come

785
00:43:13,728 --> 00:43:15,872
so I can pay the phone bill.

786
00:43:15,904 --> 00:43:17,792
I asked for an extension
from the power company.

787
00:43:17,824 --> 00:43:21,056
Why? Because on paper,
we have no money.

788
00:43:21,088 --> 00:43:23,232
You are completely
overreacting.

789
00:43:23,264 --> 00:43:25,024
I'm not apologizing

790
00:43:25,056 --> 00:43:27,520
for wanting to celebrate
in some small way.

791
00:43:27,584 --> 00:43:29,728
I'm not asking you
to apologize, Walt.

792
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,968
I'm asking you to be smart.

793
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,264
I bought one bottle
of champagne,

794
00:43:35,296 --> 00:43:38,208
one single bottle, Skyler.

795
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,640
I paid cash. That's it.

796
00:43:40,672 --> 00:43:42,592
That's all it takes, okay?

797
00:43:42,624 --> 00:43:43,648
I mean, look at Watergate.

798
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,120
One... One little piece
of duct tape

799
00:43:45,152 --> 00:43:46,656
- left in a door...
- Oh, my God.

800
00:43:46,688 --> 00:43:48,800
Brought down the president
of the United States.

801
00:43:48,832 --> 00:43:50,720
What, I'm Nixon now?

802
00:43:50,752 --> 00:43:51,808
No, what I'm saying is

803
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,888
the devil is in
the details, okay?

804
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,312
One little mistake,
one slip-up in our story,

805
00:43:57,344 --> 00:43:59,680
that could ruin us.

806
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,952
Fine.

807
00:44:17,472 --> 00:44:19,296
Got to destroy the evidence.

808
00:44:24,032 --> 00:44:25,952
<i>When I look at this...
This image</i>

809
00:44:25,984 --> 00:44:27,616
<i>that is part of the record,</i>

810
00:44:27,648 --> 00:44:31,168
<i>I am very concerned about
what sort of distraction</i>

811
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,512
<i>that can be,</i>

812
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:33,856
<i>whether it's from any
sort of signage</i>

813
00:44:33,888 --> 00:44:35,392
<i>but especially a signage</i>

814
00:44:35,424 --> 00:44:37,664
<i>that's changing
every five seconds.</i>

815
00:44:37,696 --> 00:44:39,840
<i>Thank you.</i>

816
00:44:39,872 --> 00:44:42,432
<i>Any other questions?</i>

817
00:44:42,464 --> 00:44:45,216
<i>We have a motion
and a second on the floor</i>

818
00:44:45,248 --> 00:44:46,592
<i>to grant the appeal.</i>

819
00:44:46,624 --> 00:44:47,744
<i>All those in favor,</i>

820
00:44:47,776 --> 00:44:49,216
<i>raise your hand and say yes.</i>

821
00:44:49,248 --> 00:44:51,552
<i>Yes is for the affirmative.</i>

822
00:44:51,584 --> 00:44:53,216
<i>Those opposed?</i>

823
00:44:53,248 --> 00:44:57,632
<i>There's five no's,
and that motion fails.</i>

824
00:44:57,664 --> 00:44:59,264
<i>I would like to make a motion</i>

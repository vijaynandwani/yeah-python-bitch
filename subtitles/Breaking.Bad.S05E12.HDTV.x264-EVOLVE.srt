106

is no longer
coming out of the nozzle,

108

to put it back

Yeah, but you gotta understand,

So... where is he?

- Still looking.

uh, this Brock kid's place.

Uh, Badger and Skinny Pete.

Yeah, no, he's not with them.

179

They could be covering for him.

180

the tall kid's mom's place.

all he talked about was
something called <i>Babylon 5.</i>

I checked with my gal at APD.

185

Uh, she said Pinkman's
not in their system,

186
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:25,829
so the cops don't have him.

Yet.

188
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:29,183

I mean,
Pinkman's like a bad penny.

196
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,116
Sooner or later,
he's gonna turn up.

197
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,019
I'm wondering what
you wanna do when he does.

Jesse is upset about the boy.

199
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,157
I just need to explain to him

200
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:54,792
why that had to happen.

201
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,630
Okay, but say, you know,

202
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,582

204
00:15:02,884 --> 00:15:04,919
for a nuanced discussion

205

of child poisoning.

more towards stabbing you to death

In that scenario, then what?

You have a suggestion?

210
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:19,100
We were wondering

211
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:24,188
if maybe this isn't
an "Old Yeller" type situation.

212
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:26,657
"Old Yeller"?

213
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,409

let me into the ice room,

to the front desk.

How's Saul doing?

Saul? Goodman?

No?

You were just out talking
to him in the parking lot.

I'm sorry.
Were you spying on me?

Yes.

just awful about it too.

He came over to the house
that time for dinner, remember?

for very good reasons.

burn our house down?

probably for a brief moment,
his intention,

259

but obviously
he changed his mind.

But he has always been more of a
danger to himself than anyone else.

to fly off the handle.

what's your course
of action here?

277

Saul's guy, Kuby,
tracks him down,

Last night I was online for six hours

had been keeping a secret
from you and Hank,

are we talking about?

about that at all.

Dave, can't we simply

406
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:01,815
just focus on my feelings here?

407
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:04,418

really matter, do they?

to be done, okay?

something else, please?

you're not ready
to fill me in here,

that's fine.

no matter how difficult

or painful
or seemingly unsolvable,

428
00:28:08,733 --> 00:28:10,517
that violence won't make worse.

429
00:28:11,987 --> 00:28:14,405
I know. I...

430
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:16,574
Don't worry.
I wouldn't hurt anybody.

You thought I might wanna
pack up and move out of my own house.

Why?
What's going on?

get into it now.

No. No, no, no,

five minutes later.

Just business stuff.

493
00:31:52,751 --> 00:31:54,719
Going over some options.

you might buy another car wash?

Well, maybe.

How it goes now that--

00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:11,435
now that you're--
you're sick again, right?

499

No. That's not
what I mean.

500
00:32:15,107 --> 00:32:18,192
Hey. Told you not to worry,
remember?

Come on.

00:32:23,832 --> 00:32:26,000
just to let something
as silly as lung cancer

505

take me down?

by burning him
to the ground, right?

I-I got stories

[Beeps]

553
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:33,346
Start from the beginning.

00:36:33,364 --> 00:36:35,849
When did you
first meet Walter White?

555
00:36:37,952 --> 00:36:40,404
Right. Okay, uh...

556
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:46,577
I first met Mr. White--

557
00:36:46,628 --> 00:36:48,879
Walter White--

558
00:36:48,913 --> 00:36:52,082
in junior year chemistry.

559
00:36:54,669 --> 00:36:57,037
He was my teacher.

560
00:37:11,936 --> 00:37:13,904
You believe him?

561
00:37:13,938 --> 00:37:16,690
Yeah.
I do, unfortunately.

562
00:37:16,724 --> 00:37:18,692
And I hate to admit it,

563
00:37:18,726 --> 00:37:21,278
but I think the kid is right.

564
00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:23,730
There is no physical evidence,
not that I heard.

565

Yeah, well, no weapons,

Uh, made you a 50-50 partner.
He didn't need to do that.

Yeah, no, he sort of did. I'm the
only one near as good as him, so...

I don't know.

hire some, uh--

is supposed to happen--

the exact reverse opposite

another way to get the man,

00:41:14,178 --> 00:41:16,430
[Exhales forcefully]
What?

650
00:41:16,464 --> 00:41:19,316
What if the kid's right?
What if it's a trap?

651
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,685
"The kid"?

652
00:41:21,736 --> 00:41:24,237
Oh, you mean
the junkie murderer

653
00:41:24,272 --> 00:41:26,473
that's dribbling all over
my guest bathroom floor?

654
00:41:28,192 --> 00:41:30,360
Well, then, he's right.

655
00:41:30,411 --> 00:41:32,812
Pinkman gets killed,

656
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,332
and we get it all on tape.

657
00:41:41,736 --> 00:41:44,004
[Hank] Remember, you're
hurt, you're angry,

658
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:46,006
but you're here
for answers, okay?

659
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,676
But don't, uh--
don't push the questions, okay?

660
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,178
Let's not get him suspicious,
all right?

661
00:41:51,212 --> 00:41:54,265
You let him do the talking,
right?

662
00:41:54,316 --> 00:41:56,400
Just relax. That's what--
that's what matters most.

663
00:41:56,434 --> 00:41:58,435
Don't cross your arms,
if you can help it.

664
00:42:01,323 --> 00:42:02,856
Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.

<i>Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.</i>
<i>You getting that?</i>

Loud and clear, <i>idiota.</i>

667
00:42:06,728 --> 00:42:08,228
<i>How's it looking, Gomie?</i>

668
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,915
[Gomez]
No change.

669
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:12,866
<i>He's just sitting there.</i>

670
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,835
<i>Are we doing this, or what?</i>

671
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:16,870
Ready to kick some ass, partner?
[Pats]

672
00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:23,294
All right.
Time to go.

673
00:42:24,963 --> 00:42:26,096

[Gasps]

679
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,292
[Gomez] Hey, Hank, you got eyes on this?
What's with the kid?

680
00:43:45,326 --> 00:43:47,327
He's just standing there.

681
00:43:47,345 --> 00:43:50,163
<i>What the hell's he doing?</i>

682
00:44:11,736 --> 00:44:14,371
He's on the move now.

683
00:44:14,406 --> 00:44:15,989
He's taking off.
I think he's running.

684
00:44:16,023 --> 00:44:18,191
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, kid.
Come on.

685
00:44:26,885 --> 00:44:30,003
[Gomez] You got him?
He's at the pay phone.

686
00:44:30,037 --> 00:44:32,172
Who the hell is he calling?

687
00:44:34,426 --> 00:44:36,677
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Come on, kid.

688
00:44:36,711 --> 00:44:38,645
No! Come on!

Nice try, asshole.

<i>I just wanna talk to you.</i>

696
00:45:00,401 --> 00:45:03,737
No. I'm not doing what you want anymore.
Okay, asshole?

697
00:45:03,755 --> 00:45:07,040
<i>This is just a heads-up to let
you know I'm coming for you.</i>

698

Next time, I'm gonna get you

Get in.

Little son of a bitch!

Stupid, high little--

What the hell
was that all about, huh?

712
00:46:08,153 --> 00:46:09,653
What were you thinking?

713
00:46:09,687 --> 00:46:11,688
- Thinking there's another way.
- What?

714
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,492
To get him.
There's another way.

715
00:46:17,662 --> 00:46:19,613
A better way.

1
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,124
Think you'll be okay
waiting here by yourself?

2
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,836
Yeah, whatever.

3
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:30,799
Sir, if you'd like to smoke, you need
to be another 20 feet from the door.

4
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:34,011
So roll me further, bitch.

5
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:56,909
What's coming?

6
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,162
Male, Caucasian. Early 40s.
Multiple gunshot wounds.

7
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,919
BP is 70. Seven-zero over palp.

8
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,964
Pulse 140. One-four-zero.
Weak and thready at the brachial.

9
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,592
No breath sounds on the right side,
belly is rigid.

10
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,261
Appears pale and diaphoretic.
How many entry wounds?

11
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,722
Four. Shoulder and hip,
through and through.

12
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:22,518
Right lung in lower left quadrant,
no visible... exit wounds.

13
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,228
Let's get him 2 grams of oxygen.

14
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,730
- What's his haemoglobin?
- Seven-point-three.

15
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,400
Need two large-bore IVs,
six units O-neg.

16
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,445
Type and cross for six more units,
chest x-ray and KUB.

17
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,490
Notify the OR, we are on the way.

18
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,410
OR 1 is clear. Let's put him in there.

19
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:13,193
Yo, Jesse, sorry I'm late, man.

20
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,407
Damn, brother, look at you.

21
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,742
That's messed up.

22
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,412
How are you feeling? You okay?

23
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,455
Actually...

24
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,459
...I'm great.

25
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,443
I don't understand.

26
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,778
I thought things
were going pretty well.

27
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,699
I thought we were kind of simpatico.

28
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:04,536
You know?
We were becoming a real team.

29
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:09,124
Not... Not so much, no.

30
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:13,712
Is this about the temperature setting?
I can assure you that will not happen...

31
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,714
No, it's bigger than that, Gale.

32
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:19,676
It's much more than that.

33
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,720
Could you elaborate?

34
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,389
Well, yes, of course I could...

35
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:28,227
...but I don't think either of us...

36
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:31,230
...would necessarily benefit
from a prolonged...

37
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,359
Yeah, so...

38
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:36,693
Yeah.

39
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,446
I set up the... entire lab.

40
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,990
You said you liked the configuration.

41
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,909
And I do.

42
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,203
For the most part.

43
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:51,291
Look, you're a fine chemist, really,
with a promising future.

44
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,628
It's just that I...

45
00:04:54,837 --> 00:05:01,844
That we just have different rhythms,
Gale.

46
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,345
You see... It's...

47
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:08,267
It's as if I'm classical...

48
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:13,981
...but you are more jazz.

49
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,776
- Jazz.
- Jazz. Yes.

50
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,696
And God knows
there is nothing wrong with jazz.

51
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:26,577
It's simply that I require...

52
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,454
- Classical.
- Exactly.

53
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,542
Oh, shit.

54
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:36,753
Man, this is the bomb.

55
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,971
What's up, partner?

56
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:51,602
- I can't believe this.
- My replacement?

57
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,812
Oh, Jesus.

58
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,481
Hi. Gale.

59
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,817
- Nice to meet you.
- What's up?

60
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,528
Man. We should've ditched that RV
months ago.

61
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:04,239
It's all, like, shiny up in here.

62
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,997
I'm sorry, I must be missing something.
I don't mean... I don't mean to be...

63
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,167
- This...
- No.

64
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,046
- Makes no sense.

65
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:31,266
So I guess this is...

66
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,147
Oh, dear mother of God.

67
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,485
This is for the best.

68
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,572
Two hundred pounds a week. Got it?

69
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,616
Yeah.

70
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,952
Oh, man.

71
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,913
Mr. White.

72
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,052
Okay, there's a lot to show you.

73
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,513
Some new techniques to learn.

74
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:13,100
- What, now?
- Yes, now.

75
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,270
We've only got a couple days
before our next batch is due.

76
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,146
And I need to get you up to speed.

77
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:23,235
Right on. I'm just saying...

78
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,364
How's the cell service down here?

79
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,157
It's nonexistent.

80
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,784
We're shielded.

81
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:33,287
There's a hard line for emergencies.
Come on.

82
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,664
So you haven't talked
to anybody today...

83
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:38,458
...other than, you know,
Captain Nerd there.

84
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:40,752
Why?

85
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,589
Your brother-in-law.

86
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,008
What about him?

87
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,555
- What's the story?
- He was unresponsive.

88
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,849
You getting exposure
on those wounds?

89
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,101
- Two units of normal saline.
- Bivalve mass.

90
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,229
Breath sounds bilaterally.
Femur's like a wet bag of gravel.

91
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,899
Other one's not much better.
Get those boots off.

92
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:05,152
See if you get a pulse.
Get blood-pressure cup or an ABI?

93
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,445
Where's that blood?

94
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:09,573
<i>Dr. Bording to Cardiology.</i>

95
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,117
<i>Dr. Bording to Cardiology.</i>

96
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,494
- Sir, can I help you?
- Yeah, I...

97
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,164
- It's all right. He's family.
- Thank you.

98
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:22,794
Marie. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, honey.

99
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,176
I'm so sorry.

100
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,970
I don't know what to say.

101
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:41,021
- How is he?
- I don't know.

102
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,107
They won't really tell us anything.
He's still in surgery.

103
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:48,070
They shot him four times.

104
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,031
Oh, Christ.

105
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,913
- Where's Holly?
- I got a sitter.

106
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,544
- Hey, how are you, huh?
- Fine.

107
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,212
Yeah?

108
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,465
Sure?

109
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:12,761
I'm fine. I just need some fresh air.

110
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,181
Okay.

111
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,811
- Here. Let me get the door.
- I got it. I'm fine.

112
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:29,111
Walt. Walt, this is ASAC Merkert.
Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.

113
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,321
- Hello.
- I'm very sorry.

114
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,823
Thank you.

115
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,368
Can you tell us anything
or any details?

116
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:39,121
Right now, all we know
is two men ambushed Hank.

117
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,291
They didn't have any ID on them.
Probably Mexican nationals.

118
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,920
Their tattoos indicated an affiliation
with the drug cartel.

119
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,341
Why did they attack Hank?

120
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,968
We're not sure yet.

121
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:57,181
It could be in relation to a investigation
Hank was working...

122
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:01,810
...or it could be a message
to the DEA in general.

123
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,606
They had an axe.

124
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:10,068
The cartels tend to be dramatic.

125
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,070
Jesus.

126
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,993
- Where are they? I mean, did they...?
- Hank got both of them.

127
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:21,872
He killed one outright, the other one's
upstairs in critical condition.

128
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,751
Your brother-in-law's one tough
son of a bitch to take them both out...

129
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,629
...considering
he didn't even have his gun.

130
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,509
He didn't have his gun?

131
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:40,807
Why didn't Hank have his gun?

132
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,727
Marie, the assault charge.

133
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:46,688
I had to suspend Hank
pending the investigation.

134
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:49,816
That means
I had to take away his weapon.

135
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,527
You had to take it.

136
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:54,571
- It's standard procedure. No one...
- Okay. All right, listen.

137
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,326
If you all listened to him from the start
and let him arrest that degenerate...

138
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:02,037
...he wouldn't have taken things
into his own hands.

139
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,915
And he would've had a gun
and could've defended himself.

140
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,376
- Marie, let's just...
- No. Just...

141
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,296
It's their fault.

142
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,507
He didn't have a gun.

143
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,717
Honey, this isn't helping you.

144
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,553
You.

145
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,722
What kind of partner are you?

146
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:25,644
You were supposed to back him up,
and where were you?

147
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:27,688
Where were you?

148
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,731
Texas.

149
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:32,860
And you.

150
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:36,196
You're supposed
to protect your agents...

151
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:38,448
...instead of taking their guns...

152
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:41,451
...not supporting them,
not backing them up.

153
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,120
- Marie. Marie.
- When they...

154
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:47,875
Honey, let's just go and sit down,
okay?

155
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,880
I'm not doing anything until these two
get the hell out of here. I mean it.

156
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,262
- Sorry...
- Go.

157
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,347
You are not welcome here.

158
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:06,894
- The DEA is not welcome here.
- Okay, honey.

159
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,228
Come on.

160
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,772
Come on. Let's go sit down.

161
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,412
It's not just them.

162
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,499
It's you, Walt.

163
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:40,344
This Pinkman
that Hank was looking for...

164
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,430
...Hank would have never
even heard his name...

165
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:47,351
...if you hadn't bought marijuana
from him.

166
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,437
- Marie...
- Do you ever think about that, Walt?

167
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:52,314
Do you?

168
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,651
Do you think about everything
that you have put him through?

169
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,903
Marie, stop.

170
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:01,198
You're upset, and you're looking
for someone to blame...

171
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,117
...and it's understandable,
but don't blame Walt.

172
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,787
It's not his fault.

173
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,921
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

174
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,924
- Sweetheart...
- No. No. Don't...

175
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,181
- It's okay.
- It's Hank.

176
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,100
It's all right.

177
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,244
All right, you're done.

178
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,665
Okay, next.

179
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,010
Hello.

180
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:32,140
Hello, hello, hello.

181
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,231
Yeah.

182
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:53,245
Yo, yo, yo.
Jesse Pinkman in the house.

183
00:15:55,581 --> 00:16:00,711
Oh, my dear God.

184
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,665
<i>Walter White</i>
<i>to the nearest courtesy phone.</i>

185
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:42,461
<i>Walter White,</i>
<i>please pick up a courtesy phone.</i>

186
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,099
<i>Yo, we working sometime this year?</i>

187
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,938
What the hell are you thinking?
Why are you calling me here?

188
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,690
Tried your cell
and it went straight to voicemail.

189
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,360
- How am I to get a hold of you?
- You aren't.

190
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:09,446
<i>It's been a whole day.</i>
<i>How long is this grieving process?</i>

191
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,281
Just put a clock on it for me.

192
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:14,326
<i>All I'm saying</i>
<i>is we have a schedule, right?</i>

193
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:17,079
My family
comes before your schedule.

194
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,289
<i>Dude, it's not my schedule.</i>

195
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:23,836
- We have responsibilities here.
<i>- I'll get there when I get there.</i>

196
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:28,006
You know what? Whatever.
I'll just cook on my own.

197
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:30,926
- You will do no such thing.
<i>- Why not?</i>

198
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:33,804
<i>Well, for starters...</i>

199
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,974
<i>...you aren't the least bit familiar</i>
<i>with any of the equipment.</i>

200
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:39,643
<i>There's gotta be some sort of manual,</i>
<i>right?</i>

201
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,688
- And I can read.
<i>- Jesse, touch nothing.</i>

202
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:45,023
<i>Stop treating me</i>
<i>lik e I'm lik e your assistant.</i>

203
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:48,777
I'm not your bitch to order around.
We're partners. Remember?

204
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:55,158
I need you to sit patiently and wait,
I will be there as soon as I can.

205
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,494
Thank you very much
for your kind words.

206
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:01,540
- We really do appreciate that.
- What, is your wife there?

207
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,625
<i>Yes. Yes, she is.</i>

208
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,420
She would be happy to know
you asked about her.

209
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:08,255
Please do keep us in your thoughts.

210
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,465
Hey, tell your douche bag
brother-in-law...

211
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,718
...to head towards the light.

212
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:19,224
So I'm thinking maybe we should go
get everybody some breakfast.

213
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:23,187
Yeah, that sounds good.
Do you know who that was?

214
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:43,207
You know,
these... eggs are really not too bad.

215
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:59,223
- Look at that.
- Look at what?

216
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:02,518
At what? This. These spots.

217
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:05,395
This fork is absolutely filthy.

218
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,986
Tell me you see this.
You've got good eyes. Look at that.

219
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:16,490
Marie, those are just water spots.

220
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:17,699
That's fine.

221
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:20,410
Those are not "water spots."

222
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,579
That's dirt.

223
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:26,083
This silverware's
obviously not been cleaned.

224
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,920
It's covered in germs
from someone... else's mouth.

225
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,339
God knows what.

226
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:36,343
Seriously, Aunt Marie,
it's water spots.

227
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,555
Ours at home aren't any better.

228
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:42,641
Yours at home are irrelevant.
We're in a hospital.

229
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,978
They need to be a higher standard.
They have a responsibility.

230
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:47,688
Well, I'm not actually sure...

231
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:51,775
...if the cafeteria necessarily qualifies
as being part of the hospital.

232
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:55,070
It's in the same building.
It's all under the same roof.

233
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,822
Do you think that sick people...

234
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,700
...aren't eating
with this bacteria-infested silverware?

235
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:02,995
My God, how are you supposed
to survive this death trap?

236
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:07,541
Marie...

237
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,004
I survived.

238
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:16,049
I had my lobectomy at this hospital.

239
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,885
Remember that?

240
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:21,305
Remember how scared we all were?

241
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:27,144
I didn't wanna act like it,
but I was terrified.

242
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:30,564
All that week, all I could think of...

243
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:35,360
...was how they were actually
going to cut me open...

244
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,655
...and take out a part of me...

245
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,992
...that was with me my entire life.

246
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:44,411
I couldn't get that image
out of my head.

247
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:53,253
I think the scariest part
was when they took me into pre-op.

248
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:58,592
Lying there,
waiting for them to anesthetise you.

249
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:04,223
Knowing that you may never
wake up again.

250
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:15,317
Actually what I really remember
about that day...

251
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:17,986
...is driving to the hospital.

252
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:20,989
Skyler, you remember me
wanting to drive that day?

253
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,367
Yeah.

254
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:27,371
Anyway, there we are.
We're driving up Central...

255
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:30,707
...and we hit every green light.

256
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:36,004
I mean,
every single light that we hit... green.

257
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:39,508
It's just... When does that happen?

258
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:46,139
Just like, bang, bang,
green the... entire way.

259
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:50,477
And the whole time,
all I could think about was:

260
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:56,066
"Why today? Why?
Why can't I just spend...

261
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:59,319
...a few extra minutes in the car
with my family?"

262
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:05,742
I never wanted to be stuck in traffic
so bad in my life.

263
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:10,038
At least I was with my family.

264
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:13,876
I had that.

265
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:23,385
Anyway, I survived this place.

266
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:27,598
And I'm not half the man
your husband is.

267
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,710
Yes?

268
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:59,087
<i>What the hell is going on up there?</i>

269
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:01,340
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

270
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,008
You know about my men?

271
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:06,845
<i>I heard that they attack ed a DEA agent.</i>
<i>Why would they do that?</i>

272
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:11,016
What's the matter?
Spanish not good enough anymore?

273
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:16,188
I didn't order this, and my men
would never do this on their own.

274
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:19,107
Someone gave the go-ahead.

275
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:21,568
<i>Are you accusing me?</i>

276
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:24,363
I'm just saying
they wouldn't act on their own.

277
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:27,658
I am not in the habit
of picking my own pocket.

278
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:32,079
I assume that the next shipment
will be delayed.

279
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:35,749
<i>- Any thoughts on when it might arrive?</i>
- A week, a month.

280
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:40,003
There's too much focus on the border.
We lay low for the time being.

281
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:42,339
We lay low,
and then we get the real story...

282
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:44,007
...from my man who survived.

283
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:47,010
Your man is in custody.

284
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:48,303
God bless America!

285
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:51,056
He's innocent until proven guilty.
Correct?

286
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:52,975
I'll get him the best lawyer...

287
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,185
<i>...and then we'll learn the truth.</i>

288
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:58,021
Well, keep me apprised.

289
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,111
Any time you got that close proximity
to the spine...

290
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,613
...there's always gonna be cause
for concern...

291
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:09,575
...but as I say,
it's really too soon to tell.

292
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:12,327
He's out of surgery, at least, which is...

293
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:15,831
- Out of surgery, on way to recovery.
- All right. And where's that?

294
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,041
Unfortunately, you can't see him yet.

295
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,377
We're gonna have to wait
for him to stabilize.

296
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,172
How long will that take?

297
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,424
I can't really say. It could be hours.

298
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:28,886
But we'll let you know
just as soon as you can see him.

299
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:32,139
Thank you.

300
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,981
Maybe we should get you home
for a couple hours?

301
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,150
Get some rest?

302
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:45,903
I'm not going anywhere.

303
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,988
Me neither.

304
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:57,873
Well, is anyone... else
dying to brush their teeth...

305
00:24:58,081 --> 00:24:59,708
...or is it just me?

306
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,254
What if I ran over to the house
and picked up a few things?

307
00:25:04,463 --> 00:25:07,007
Marie? I could swing by your place.

308
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:10,344
That would be great. Thanks, Walt.

309
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:13,764
Okay.

310
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,864
Walt. Walt.

311
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:33,075
We just heard he came through.

312
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:36,703
Yeah, well, it's, you know,
guardedly good news.

313
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:38,830
- Thank God. I'll take it.
- Yeah.

314
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,167
Hey, guys,
this is Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.

315
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:44,503
- Good to meet you. Hi.
- Hey.

316
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:48,215
- We were just swapping Hank stories.
- That could go on all day.

317
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:50,634
God knows,
there's a million of them.

318
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:55,722
- Meanwhile...
- Miserable piece of shit.

319
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:58,517
Guy who shot him, one that's left,
he's up there.

320
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:01,520
Got the painkillers going on,
resting comfortably.

321
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,272
Your tax dollars at work.

322
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:05,941
Gotta see what Hank did
to that bastard.

323
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:09,194
Wanna see?

324
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:11,989
Come on, let me show you.

325
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:35,888
You comfortable, you piece of shit?

326
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:36,573
- You got him?
- Come on.

327
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:40,202
- All right.
- Easy now, easy.

328
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:14,778
Come here.

329
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,533
No.

330
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:24,288
Oh, shit.

331
00:28:31,003 --> 00:28:32,880
Oh, sheesh.

332
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:35,048
Oh, sheesh.

333
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:38,427
One for you and two for...

334
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:15,005
Yeah.

335
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:29,228
Finally. About damn time.

336
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:44,117
Why isn't there anything cooking?

337
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:03,345
<i>Walter White</i>
<i>to the nearest courtesy phone.</i>

338
00:30:04,555 --> 00:30:06,849
<i>- Operator.</i>
- This is Walter White.

339
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:08,767
<i>I'll connect you.</i>

340
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:14,857
<i>Yo, we got problems, big ones.</i>

341
00:30:15,065 --> 00:30:18,777
Reverend, so nice of you to call.
Again.

342
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:20,320
Turn your phone on already.

343
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:23,574
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I will definitely look into that.</i>

344
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:27,619
I'll tell you what. Why don't I just
call you right back on my cell phone?

345
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:29,204
Okay?

346
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:34,626
I told you to wait. I don't know
how many more ways I could say it.

347
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:36,753
<i>Yeah, dick, I was waiting...</i>

348
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:39,631
<i>...and then that creepy, quiet guy</i>
<i>showed up.</i>

349
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:42,551
- Gus came by?
- Not him, man.

350
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,053
Apparently
I'm not worthy of meeting him.

351
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:47,931
The other one.
The one I'm qualified to speak to.

352
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,641
He started asking questions too.

353
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:53,812
<i>Lik e why haven't we cook ed anything.</i>
<i>All right, we have a quota.</i>

354
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:57,566
It's due tomorrow.
Do you seriously not care or what?

355
00:30:57,774 --> 00:31:00,652
<i>Because that guy,</i>
<i>he's got, lik e, the dead eyes.</i>

356
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:02,070
Let me ask you something.

357
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,990
Do you remember when we were
out in the desert with Tuco?

358
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:08,410
Oh, you mean when he put
a machine gun to my head?

359
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:11,371
Yeah, I think that does ring a tiny bell.
Why?

360
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,041
No. He kept... He kept saying...

361
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:17,878
...that someone was coming up
from Mexico to get us.

362
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:20,589
Do you remember?
Now, who was that?

363
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:25,093
What the hell has this got to do with...?
Look, I don't know. It was...

364
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:29,932
His cousins.

365
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,393
Right, Jesse? It was...
It was his cousins.

366
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:36,104
Yeah, cousins.

367
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:37,856
Whatever, man. Why?

368
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:58,418
Any news?

369
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:00,420
No change.

370
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:08,262
Okay, well, I didn't know
whose toothbrushes were whose...

371
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,431
...so I just stopped by the drugstore.

372
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:14,017
Thank God for travel sizes, right?

373
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:15,644
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

374
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:18,772
Yeah.

375
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:25,612
Oh, I think I'm gonna
go wash my face.

376
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,781
I'm going crazy.

377
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:31,827
- Do you wanna come?
- Yeah.

378
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:41,712
<i>Nurse Franklin,</i>
<i>please page the operator.</i>

379
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,423
<i>Nurse Franklin, page the operator.</i>

380
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:50,429
I got candy bars.

381
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:56,768
Is this what you were asking for?

382
00:32:56,977 --> 00:32:58,979
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

383
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:02,441
Yeah, I skimmed through it.

384
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:04,985
- Looks interesting.
- Yeah.

385
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:08,322
Uncle Hank gave it to me.

386
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:14,494
Well, what's it about?

387
00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:22,002
Pablo Escobar,
this big drug guy in the... 80s.

388
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:25,255
Yeah. Yeah.
I remember seeing him on the news.

389
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:30,427
Well, it's more about the guys
who investigated him...

390
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:33,055
...and tried to bring him down.

391
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:36,225
Some of them were DEA, you know?

392
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:41,605
Uncle Hank said
that they were worth learning about...

393
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:44,858
...that everybody knows
who Pablo Escobar is...

394
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:48,737
...but nobody knows about the guys
that brought him down.

395
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:52,824
I guess I never thought about it.

396
00:33:55,869 --> 00:34:02,960
He said that good guys never get ink
like the bad guys do.

397
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:13,929
So he gave it to me.

398
00:34:14,513 --> 00:34:16,765
Figured I'd read it.

399
00:34:30,654 --> 00:34:32,739
I need to...

400
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:34,908
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

401
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:46,086
No, I assure you.
We are hard at work. Absolutely.

402
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:49,923
<i>So I can expect delivery by tomorrow</i>
<i>as scheduled.</i>

403
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:52,134
Well...

404
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:54,678
Unfortunately...

405
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:56,555
<i>Unfortunately...</i>

406
00:34:56,763 --> 00:35:00,893
<i>...we're not going to be able</i>
<i>to k eep our schedule this week.</i>

407
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:03,270
But not for lack of trying.

408
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:05,480
Is there something I should know?

409
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:09,526
Well, to be completely honest
with you...

410
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:12,821
...Gale really screwed us up.

411
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:17,034
I mean, not on purpose, of course,
but he just... He set us way back.

412
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:19,953
And we've been playing catch-up
ever since.

413
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:25,542
And I've had to be out
running errands...

414
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:28,045
<i>...and trying to k eep us on target.</i>

415
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:32,549
Some of the... equipment
wasn't calibrated correctly...

416
00:35:32,758 --> 00:35:35,677
Well, it's just all very technical
and boring.

417
00:35:35,886 --> 00:35:38,972
But rest assured that...

418
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:41,433
That we will do whatever it takes.

419
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:43,894
<i>It has my total attention.</i>

420
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:46,271
<i>We'll cook through week end</i>
<i>if necessary.</i>

421
00:35:47,064 --> 00:35:51,443
We will have 400 pounds for you
by next week.

422
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:56,740
I have your word on that?

423
00:35:56,949 --> 00:36:00,410
You do. You have my word on that.

424
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:04,039
<i>Thank you for the update.</i>

425
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:28,438
Yeah. Right.

426
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:32,317
Any news?

427
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:36,405
No, I'm just wandering.

428
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:41,952
- How's everybody doing?
- Well, as well as can be... expected.

429
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,163
It's this not knowing...

430
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:47,749
...that's the hardest part, I think.

431
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:51,587
Anything new on these guys?

432
00:36:51,753 --> 00:36:53,755
Who they are? What they wanted?

433
00:36:53,964 --> 00:36:57,843
No, nothing yet, but we'll get it.

434
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:03,765
Steve...

435
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:08,604
Do you think
there could maybe be others?

436
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:12,816
Buddy, nobody's getting to Hank.

437
00:37:13,025 --> 00:37:15,319
That was their one shot
and they blew it.

438
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:17,779
So no.

439
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,365
No way.

440
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:23,118
Jesus.

441
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:26,872
I'd love to walk in there and shoot
that bastard right in the head.

442
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,665
Me too.

443
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,592
Yeah?

444
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:40,385
Oh, yeah?

445
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:43,096
Great. We'll be right down.

446
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:44,556
Food's here.

447
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:46,683
Hey, you like Pollos Hermanos?

448
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:49,436
- You guys coming?
- Yeah.

449
00:37:50,521 --> 00:37:53,273
- On occasion, yeah.
- Owner's a big booster for the DEA.

450
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:56,777
He heard what happened. He's gonna
feed every cop in the building.

451
00:37:58,195 --> 00:38:00,572
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

452
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:03,700
And, apparently,
he's bringing it by personally.

453
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:15,212
- I don't even know what to say.
- That's an incredible...

454
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,090
- Good, huh?
- Delicious.

455
00:38:18,257 --> 00:38:21,134
That's so generous of you.
Thank you very much.

456
00:38:21,343 --> 00:38:23,679
Yes, thank you.
Guys, did you hear that?

457
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:26,557
Mr. Fring is offering
a 10,000-dollar reward...

458
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:28,767
...on any information about the case.

459
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:32,729
Well, that's... That's wonderful.

460
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:34,898
Wow, thank you, Mr. Fring.

461
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:37,693
You're very welcome.
Men like your husband...

462
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:40,696
...are thin blue line
between us and these animals.

463
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:42,239
I only wish I could do more.

464
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,997
Well, we do appreciate your support.

465
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:54,626
This reward could turn the tide here.
It'll really help.

466
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,755
Again,
I can't express how sorry I am.

467
00:38:58,964 --> 00:39:01,175
As it happens,
I actually met Agent Schrader.

468
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:06,430
- Really?
- Our fund run, couple of months ago.

469
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:09,558
Mr. Fring was one of our sponsors.

470
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:13,312
I talked for a few minutes
with your husband.

471
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:18,400
As a matter of fact,
Mr. White, your name came up.

472
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:22,029
Really?

473
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:26,700
Yeah, there happened to be
a collection jar out for you...

474
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:29,661
...and we spoke briefly
about your health concerns.

475
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,873
I hope that there's been good news.

476
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:37,920
Things have improved, yes.

477
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:40,339
That's wonderful to hear.

478
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:43,884
It was clear to me
how deeply he cares for you.

479
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:50,098
Well, I have taken up
enough of your time.

480
00:39:52,893 --> 00:39:56,021
Thank you again very much.
It was a great pleasure to meet you.

481
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,232
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

482
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:03,654
- Let me walk you out.
- Oh, no, it's not necessary.

483
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:12,287
You know, I didn't say thank you.

484
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:15,374
I'll walk him out. Be right back.

485
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:20,963
Good to see you.
Enjoying the chicken?

486
00:40:21,171 --> 00:40:23,841
- Good. Good... Hey.
- Excuse me.

487
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:27,386
My pleasure. My pleasure, yeah.

488
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:29,096
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

489
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:31,139
It's good chicken, huh? Yeah. Good.

490
00:40:31,348 --> 00:40:33,475
- Mr. Fring.
- Mr. White.

491
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:37,020
- I just wanted to thank you again.
- It's my pleasure.

492
00:40:37,229 --> 00:40:41,233
May I...? May I speak with you?
Just a moment.

493
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:47,322
You knew.

494
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:51,159
You knew my brother-in-law
was with the DEA.

495
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:54,580
I investigate... everyone
with whom I do business.

496
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,374
What careful man wouldn't?

497
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:02,462
He is not a problem for us,
for our business.

498
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:08,677
Your being here is...

499
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:12,181
Is this some sort of message?

500
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:14,683
I'm supporting my community.

501
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:17,603
I hide in plain sight, same as you.

502
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:19,563
- Are we done?
- No, listen, I...

503
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:23,108
This attack on my brother-in-law,
I don't understand it.

504
00:41:23,317 --> 00:41:25,194
I don't know what it means.

505
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:29,489
Please,
if you have some knowledge...

506
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:31,909
...that you could share with me...

507
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:38,707
I fear for my family.

508
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:40,292
I'm sure they'll be fine.

509
00:41:40,751 --> 00:41:44,254
I am told the assassin that survived
is gravely injured.

510
00:41:44,463 --> 00:41:46,590
It's doubtful he'll live.

511
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:52,763
Now thank me and shake my hand.

512
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:01,104
- Thank you. Thank you again.
- You're quite welcome, Mr. White.

513
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:05,442
Did you hear that?

514
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:11,782
- We're going up?
- Come on.

515
00:42:12,157 --> 00:42:13,867
What's going on?

516
00:42:14,743 --> 00:42:16,453
What's happening?

517
00:42:16,828 --> 00:42:20,290
Starting chest compressions.
One, two, three, four.

518
00:42:20,832 --> 00:42:22,251
- One, two, three...
- Defib?

519
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:25,337
Patient is in asystole.
Continuing chest compressions.

520
00:42:25,921 --> 00:42:27,422
One, two, three, four.

521
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:30,008
- Give me a litre of saline.
- I can't get a pulse.

522
00:42:30,425 --> 00:42:31,718
One, two, three, four.

523
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:35,097
- Still nothing.
- All right, stopping compressions.

524
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:37,558
- Time?
- Eight forty-three.

525
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:39,768
Time of death, 20:43.

526
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:44,940
Burn in hell, you piece of shit.

527
00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:12,634
Yes? Juan?

528
00:43:12,843 --> 00:43:14,553
<i>I assume you heard the news.</i>

529
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:17,431
Your man died. I heard.

530
00:43:17,556 --> 00:43:20,142
- It's unfortunate.
<i>- Yeah, unfortunate.</i>

531
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:23,187
And meanwhile, I have Federales
surrounding my house.

532
00:43:23,395 --> 00:43:27,065
You know what I think, Gustavo?
I think you're behind all this.

533
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:29,526
Why would I do this?

534
00:43:29,735 --> 00:43:32,905
- How would it see... me?
- That's the part I'm trying to figure out.

535
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:35,240
Go off on your own, maybe.

536
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:37,409
Would you actually think
that would work?

537
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:40,329
<i>Juan, you sound lik e</i>
<i>you're under a lot of stress.</i>

538
00:43:40,495 --> 00:43:43,498
You should call me back when
you're seeing things more clearly.

539
00:43:43,665 --> 00:43:45,292
I see things clear enough.

540
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:49,046
One DEA gets shot,
all of Washington starts barking.

541
00:43:49,254 --> 00:43:51,340
D.F. Suddenly has to put
on a big show...

542
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:54,259
<i>...and I wind up with Federales</i>
<i>in my rosebushes.</i>

543
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:56,136
<i>But just for a while.</i>

544
00:43:56,512 --> 00:44:00,349
Appearances, politics.

545
00:44:01,016 --> 00:44:02,559
<i>Are you still there, Gustav o?</i>

546
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:04,353
Yes.

547
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:05,812
I'm here.

548
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:08,524
<i>I'll weather this. I always do.</i>

549
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,234
My brother's a police chief.

550
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:13,028
I got connections.
They'll get me through.

551
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:15,405
And when I get proof...

552
00:44:15,614 --> 00:44:18,408
...and the others find out
what you've done...

553
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:21,620
...maybe we come pay you a visit.

554
00:44:21,828 --> 00:44:23,622
<i>Maybe we can...</i>

555
00:45:11,211 --> 00:45:15,424
Skyler. Skyler. Marie. Marie.

556
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:18,385
Oh, how is he?
Tell me something good.

557
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:21,930
I think he's stable... enough now
for you to go see him briefly.

558
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:24,558
I'm sorry,
I'm afraid it's immediately family only.

559
00:45:24,766 --> 00:45:26,727
- We're all family.
- I understand.

560
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:29,897
But we have a certain protocol here
that we need...

561
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:32,524
We're all family.

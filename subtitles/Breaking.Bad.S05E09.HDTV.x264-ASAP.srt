00:23:29,528 --> 00:23:31,195
I haven't seen him.

319
00:23:31,246 --> 00:23:34,148
Just as well, probably.

320
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,650
That whole thing
in the jails--

321
00:23:36,668 --> 00:23:38,452
I mean, when they start
to whack the lawyers,

322
00:23:38,486 --> 00:23:39,921
that's when I draw the line.

323
00:23:39,955 --> 00:23:44,342
This goes to
Kaylee Ehrmantraut,

324
00:23:44,376 --> 00:23:50,298
and that goes
to Mr. and Mrs. Albert Sharp.

325
00:23:50,332 --> 00:23:54,468
315 East Pueblo.
It's up in White Horse.

326
00:23:54,502 --> 00:23:56,687
It's 2 1/2 million each.

327
00:23:56,722 --> 00:23:59,190
A total of five.

328
00:23:59,224 --> 00:24:00,725
[Lock clicks]

329
00:24:00,776 --> 00:24:02,727
Mr. and Mrs., uh, who?

330
00:24:02,778 --> 00:24:05,279
Drew Sharp's parents.

331
00:24:05,314 --> 00:24:08,783
Drew Sharp-- that's the kid on TV.
The missing, uh--

332
00:24:08,817 --> 00:24:12,153
So but why would you, uh--
Scratch that.

333
00:24:12,187 --> 00:24:14,038
I don't know,
and I don't wanna know.

334
00:24:14,072 --> 00:24:17,742
Uh, thing is,
what those folks want

335
00:24:17,793 --> 00:24:19,410
is to know what happened
to their boy.

336
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:21,245
Sack full of cash
on their doorstep--

337
00:24:21,296 --> 00:24:23,748
that's just gonna
raise more questions.

338
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:27,718
Kaylee Ehrmantraut.
That's Mike's granddaughter?

339
00:24:27,753 --> 00:24:31,205
- So this is Mike's money?
- It's mine.

340
00:24:31,223 --> 00:24:33,207
It's your money.
Okay.

341
00:24:33,225 --> 00:24:36,002
And you're giving it
to Kaylee Ehrmantraut...

342
00:24:36,003 --> 00:24:37,960
It's what Mike wanted.

343
00:24:40,432 --> 00:24:42,650
So you and Mike, uh...

344
00:24:42,684 --> 00:24:44,718
You've been in touch?

345
00:24:49,775 --> 00:24:52,743
So we're just
talking about charity?

346
00:24:52,778 --> 00:24:54,912
Yeah.

347
00:24:54,946 --> 00:24:57,281
Okay, look.
You know, um,

348
00:24:57,332 --> 00:25:00,951
shelling out money to the ex
and her little boy-- I kinda get it.

349
00:25:01,003 --> 00:25:03,170
I mean, kinda. But this--
[Laughs]

350
00:25:03,205 --> 00:25:04,672
This is a bridge too far.

351
00:25:04,706 --> 00:25:06,374
I'm sorry to say, kid,

352
00:25:06,408 --> 00:25:10,244
but you're still gonna be
two miracles short of sainthood.

353
00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:16,350
Brass tacks, okay?
My job is to advise.

354
00:25:16,385 --> 00:25:20,221
And my advice is...
Come on, already.

355
00:25:20,255 --> 00:25:22,473
Mike left one step ahead
of the boys in blue,

356
00:25:22,524 --> 00:25:24,725
and you better believe
his family's on the radar.

357
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:26,310
A couple million bucks
shows up,

358
00:25:26,361 --> 00:25:28,312
they're gonna snatch it
<i>tout de suite.</i>

359
00:25:28,363 --> 00:25:30,398
The feds have already taken
Kaylee's money twice.

360
00:25:30,432 --> 00:25:32,599
What are you
you going for a hat trick?

361
00:25:32,617 --> 00:25:34,902
- I'll freaking do it myself, Saul.
- No, no, no!

362
00:25:34,936 --> 00:25:36,487
I was just--
I was thinking out loud.

363
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:38,989
Enough bullshit, Saul.
Are you gonna do this or not?

364
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:42,410
Yes, yes, absolutely.
I-- I live to serve.

365
00:25:45,547 --> 00:25:47,882
And, kid, you might
wanna think about

366
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:49,834
cleaning up a little,
getting some rest.

367
00:25:49,885 --> 00:25:52,286
- You've looked better.
- Just get it done.

368
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:03,230
You know who this is?
Don't hang up on me.

369
00:26:04,983 --> 00:26:06,633
Yeah, there's a problem.

370
00:26:06,651 --> 00:26:09,470
There's five million of them
here in my office.

371
00:26:09,488 --> 00:26:13,524
No. No. Don't.
Just hold onto it.

372
00:26:15,243 --> 00:26:18,312
Yes. Ye--

373
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:20,114
Yes.

374
00:26:20,148 --> 00:26:22,149
Calm down.

375
00:26:24,002 --> 00:26:25,786
I'll handle it.

376
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,154
[Beeps]

377
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,920
[Knock at door]

378
00:26:57,225 --> 00:26:59,226
[Knock at window]

379
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:07,400
[Knocking continues]

380
00:27:24,785 --> 00:27:27,220
Déjà vu, huh?

381
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:30,924
Jesus.

382
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:32,976
All right, look.

383
00:27:33,978 --> 00:27:36,513
You wanna talk me through this?

384
00:27:36,564 --> 00:27:38,898
What you were thinking?

385
00:27:41,068 --> 00:27:44,487
What you asked Saul to do?
I mean, come on.

386
00:27:44,522 --> 00:27:46,856
It's just nonsensical.

387
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,451
I mean, do you...

388
00:27:59,453 --> 00:28:01,588
You have any explanation
at all?

389
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:05,458
[Mutters]

390
00:28:05,492 --> 00:28:07,160
What?

391
00:28:08,462 --> 00:28:10,880
It's like you said.
It's...

392
00:28:10,931 --> 00:28:13,049
It's blood money.

393
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,768
I s--

394
00:28:17,021 --> 00:28:19,723
[Sighs]
Jeez. Okay. Yes. All right.

395
00:28:19,774 --> 00:28:23,226
I said that. I did.

396
00:28:24,895 --> 00:28:27,447
But it was in--
in the heat of the moment.

397
00:28:27,481 --> 00:28:30,450
I was trying to win
an argument, all right?

398
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:34,371
And I was wrong.

399
00:28:34,405 --> 00:28:36,573
This is your money.

400
00:28:36,624 --> 00:28:38,958
Come on.
You've earned it.

401
00:29:00,214 --> 00:29:01,881
Drew Sharp.

402
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:06,569
That is a terrible memory,
no doubt about it.

403
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,691
But, son...

404
00:29:12,777 --> 00:29:15,395
you need to stop focusing

405
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:18,164
on the darkness behind you.

406
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:20,533
The past is the past.

407
00:29:25,206 --> 00:29:28,208
Nothing can change
what we've done.

408
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,178
But now that's over.

409
00:29:33,464 --> 00:29:36,099
You're out,

410
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:38,301
and so am I.

411
00:29:41,055 --> 00:29:43,773
That's right.
I'm done.

412
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:48,611
I've been out
for about a month.

413
00:29:51,031 --> 00:29:54,150
And there is nothing left
for us to do

414
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:58,988
except to try to live...

415
00:30:00,825 --> 00:30:03,076
ordinary, decent lives.

416
00:30:18,726 --> 00:30:21,060
Why Kaylee Ehrmantraut?

417
00:30:24,482 --> 00:30:26,983
She needs someone
looking after her.

418
00:30:28,986 --> 00:30:31,137
Mike is perfectly capable

419
00:30:31,155 --> 00:30:33,857
of looking after
his own granddaughter.

420
00:30:36,193 --> 00:30:38,978
I don't think so.

421
00:30:38,996 --> 00:30:41,948
I don't think he is capable.

422
00:30:41,982 --> 00:30:45,201
I don't think he's coming back.

423
00:30:45,252 --> 00:30:47,587
What--
what are you saying?

424
00:30:49,957 --> 00:30:52,509
You doing what you did--

425
00:30:52,543 --> 00:30:55,211
offing Mike's guys?

426
00:30:56,213 --> 00:30:58,214
If he was out there,

427
00:30:58,265 --> 00:31:01,267
you would have to look over your
shoulder for the rest of your life,

428
00:31:01,302 --> 00:31:03,269
and that's not
how you do things.

429
00:31:03,304 --> 00:31:05,271
So I think he's dead,

430
00:31:05,306 --> 00:31:08,892
and I think you know that.

431
00:31:11,195 --> 00:31:13,730
I don't know that.

432
00:31:16,683 --> 00:31:18,368
I don't.

433
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,572
Listen to me.

434
00:31:22,623 --> 00:31:25,825
I did not kill Mike.

435
00:31:27,044 --> 00:31:29,362
The last time that I saw him,

436
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,131
he had his bag--
the one that I brought him--

437
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:34,467
and he got into his car,
and he drove away.

438
00:31:34,502 --> 00:31:37,170
And for all I know,
he is alive and well.

439
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,093
And if-- and if
he does come back,

440
00:31:44,144 --> 00:31:47,764
and he doesn't understand
why I had to do what I did...

441
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:51,818
well, then, that's on me.

442
00:31:55,656 --> 00:31:57,941
Jesse...

443
00:31:59,827 --> 00:32:02,946
I need you to believe this.

444
00:32:06,584 --> 00:32:09,836
It's not true.
It's just not.

445
00:32:12,122 --> 00:32:16,709
So he's out there.
He's okay.

446
00:32:16,743 --> 00:32:18,578
Yes.

447
00:32:18,596 --> 00:32:20,680
Mike is fine.

448
00:32:20,714 --> 00:32:23,182
Wherever he is.

449
00:32:23,217 --> 00:32:26,936
We both know that
he can take care of himself.

450
00:32:28,138 --> 00:32:30,106
And he's certainly capable

451
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,142
to provide for
his own family, okay?

452
00:32:36,597 --> 00:32:38,448
Jesse?

453
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,702
I need you to believe me.

454
00:32:47,107 --> 00:32:50,743
Yeah. Like you said.

455
00:32:51,745 --> 00:32:53,746
He's alive.

456
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,950
Yeah.

457
00:32:59,753 --> 00:33:01,888
Mike's alive.

458
00:33:05,225 --> 00:33:07,176
[Sighs]

459
00:33:08,345 --> 00:33:10,463
Absolutely.

460
00:33:18,022 --> 00:33:19,939
[Skyler] Well, you've gotta
have a college counselor.

461
00:33:19,973 --> 00:33:21,407
Are they bringing in
someone new?

462
00:33:21,442 --> 00:33:22,975
I don't know.

463
00:33:22,993 --> 00:33:24,694
Um, maybe she'll be back.

464
00:33:24,745 --> 00:33:26,913
And what if she's not?
What are you supposed to do?

465
00:33:26,947 --> 00:33:29,115
I mean, what's Louis gonna do?

466
00:33:29,149 --> 00:33:31,784
- He's-- he's not worried.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

467
00:33:31,818 --> 00:33:34,671
What's there to worry about?
It's only college, right?

468
00:33:34,705 --> 00:33:36,339
Right.

469
00:33:36,373 --> 00:33:38,758
College.
Nothing more important.

470
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:41,327
Oh. You know, Uncle Hank's
still not feeling well,

471
00:33:41,345 --> 00:33:43,963
so bowling's off
tomorrow night.

472
00:33:43,997 --> 00:33:45,298
[Walter, Jr.]
Really?

473
00:33:45,332 --> 00:33:48,801
Really. So you're spared
a night out with the family.

474
00:33:48,835 --> 00:33:51,054
You do not have to look
so happy about it.

475
00:33:51,105 --> 00:33:53,056
I'll be right back.

476
00:33:53,107 --> 00:33:54,941
Um...

477
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,561
so if bowling's off,

478
00:33:58,612 --> 00:34:02,565
can I--
can I get a late curfew?

479
00:34:11,158 --> 00:34:14,460
Ah. Ugh.

480
00:34:14,495 --> 00:34:17,697
[Retching]

481
00:35:14,438 --> 00:35:15,605
[Retching]

482
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,978
Are you gonna
turn off the light?

483
00:35:22,029 --> 00:35:24,363
Have you seen <i>Leaves Of Grass?</i>

484
00:35:24,398 --> 00:35:26,282
Hmm?

485
00:35:26,316 --> 00:35:28,701
My book.
Walt Whitman.

486
00:35:28,736 --> 00:35:30,620
Dark green hardcover?

487
00:35:30,654 --> 00:35:33,072
I didn't even know we had that.

488
00:35:34,293 --> 00:35:36,094
Hmm.

489
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:43,969
You don't think Junior...

490
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,021
You're kidding, right?

491
00:35:47,023 --> 00:35:50,308
Well, it'll show up.

492
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,711
What's wrong with Hank?

493
00:36:09,745 --> 00:36:13,882
Mm, it's a stomach bug,
sounds like.

494
00:36:14,884 --> 00:36:17,085
He hasn't been to work
all week.

495
00:36:18,254 --> 00:36:20,121
[Sighs]

496
00:36:20,139 --> 00:36:22,974
Well, good night.

497
00:36:24,927 --> 00:36:26,724
Good night.

498
00:38:34,852 --> 00:38:37,053
Mister, can you help me out?

499
00:38:37,105 --> 00:38:39,389
Spare so change?

500
00:38:50,518 --> 00:38:53,353
Hey. Come back.

501
00:38:53,371 --> 00:38:55,872
Yeah. You. Come here.

502
00:38:55,907 --> 00:38:57,908
I got something for you.

503
00:39:03,464 --> 00:39:04,748
Here.

504
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:06,583
Take it.

505
00:39:06,634 --> 00:39:08,301
Go ahead.

506
00:39:10,221 --> 00:39:12,422
Just take it.

507
00:39:14,976 --> 00:39:16,476
Take it.

508
00:39:19,313 --> 00:39:22,315
Yeah.
[Engine starts]

509
00:39:35,413 --> 00:39:37,864
[Barking]

510
00:39:51,212 --> 00:39:54,247
[Grunting]

511
00:40:00,754 --> 00:40:02,922
[Agent Scott] Anything you
want us to tell Steve Gomez?

512
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,608
He says he's worried about you.

513
00:40:04,642 --> 00:40:07,310
Yeah. Tell him
I already got two grandmas.

514
00:40:09,197 --> 00:40:12,983
Listen, tell everybody
more work and less worry.

515
00:40:15,936 --> 00:40:18,104
- We better hit it.
- Yeah.

516
00:40:18,122 --> 00:40:20,407
See ya.

517
00:40:39,343 --> 00:40:41,678
[Walt] - Hey, guys.
- Walt.

518
00:40:41,729 --> 00:40:43,847
- How are you? Good to see you.
- How you doing?

519
00:40:43,898 --> 00:40:46,633
Very good. Yeah. Well, you know.
I can't complain.

520
00:40:46,651 --> 00:40:49,236
Hey, how's your son's arm, by the way?
I was thinking about that.

521
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:51,154
It's back to 100%.
We're going to District.

522
00:40:51,188 --> 00:40:53,189
It's gonna be exciting.
When? This Saturday?

523
00:40:53,241 --> 00:40:56,359
This Saturday morning. I think
first pitch is at 10:00 AM, so, uh...

524
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,694
- 10:00.
- Yeah.

525
00:40:57,745 --> 00:40:59,362
Be there.
Should be a big crowd.

526
00:40:59,413 --> 00:41:01,781
Guys, you're still on the clock here!
Let's go!

527
00:41:01,815 --> 00:41:02,949
See you, Walt.

528
00:41:02,983 --> 00:41:04,284
- See you, Artie.
- See you, Walt.

529
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:05,818
All right, Scott.
Be well.

530
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:12,325
They're good guys, huh?

531
00:41:12,343 --> 00:41:13,927
Yeah.

532
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:16,713
- Well, it's good to see you
up and about. - Yeah.

533
00:41:16,764 --> 00:41:18,965
- How you feeling?
- Well, you know,

534
00:41:18,999 --> 00:41:22,535
I've been better, but...
I don't know.

535
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:25,271
You--
Did you get to see a doctor?

536
00:41:25,322 --> 00:41:26,940
I mean,
when one of these things

537
00:41:26,991 --> 00:41:28,408
lasts more than three days

538
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:30,159
you really should
get that checked.

539
00:41:30,194 --> 00:41:32,161
Yeah, no, I--
I did and I'm fine.

540
00:41:32,196 --> 00:41:35,064
I'm, uh-- I'm what they say
on the upswing, you know?

541
00:41:35,082 --> 00:41:37,784
Mm. Good.
Good to hear.

542
00:41:37,835 --> 00:41:39,786
Yeah.

543
00:41:39,837 --> 00:41:42,789
When I heard you weren't
going in to work, I--

544
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:47,460
Well, looks like you have
the work coming to you.

545
00:41:47,511 --> 00:41:50,079
Perks of being the boss, huh?

546
00:41:50,097 --> 00:41:52,131
Yeah, you know...

547
00:41:55,019 --> 00:41:58,087
How's, uh--
how's things at the car wash?

548
00:41:58,105 --> 00:42:00,139
- Good.
- Yeah?

549
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,108
Yeah, really good.

550
00:42:04,361 --> 00:42:06,980
Hey, did you have
any of that potato salad?

551
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:10,817
- I don't know. Ma-- maybe.
- Yeah, I mean,

552
00:42:10,868 --> 00:42:14,571
no one else got sick, so you
probably shouldn't worry about it.

553
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:21,995
Well, Skyler will be very happy to
hear that you're feeling better.

554
00:42:22,046 --> 00:42:23,463
Which reminds me.

555
00:42:23,497 --> 00:42:25,548
I better get back to it.

556
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:32,121
If there's anything I can do...

557
00:42:37,645 --> 00:42:40,129
Feel better.
[Pats back]

558
00:42:51,942 --> 00:42:53,910
You know...

559
00:42:55,279 --> 00:42:56,913
You're gonna laugh,

560
00:42:56,947 --> 00:43:00,199
but I have to ask you
about this.

561
00:43:01,368 --> 00:43:04,671
Believe it or not,
I found this on my car.

562
00:43:04,705 --> 00:43:06,873
I mean, it looks just like
the GPS tracker

563
00:43:06,924 --> 00:43:09,125
that we used on Gus Fring,
doesn't it?

564
00:43:10,327 --> 00:43:13,046
Back when we were tracking him,
just the two of us?

565
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:18,101
You wouldn't know anything
about this, would you, Hank?

566
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,695
[Garage door closing]

567
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:37,036
You okay?

568
00:43:37,071 --> 00:43:40,740
I gotta say, I don't like the way
you're looking at me right now.

569
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,248
Ugh!

570
00:43:49,299 --> 00:43:51,300
[Groaning]

571
00:43:54,638 --> 00:43:56,539
- Hank--
- It was you.

572
00:43:56,557 --> 00:43:59,392
All along, it was you!

573
00:43:59,426 --> 00:44:01,678
You son of a bitch.

574
00:44:01,712 --> 00:44:04,347
You drove into traffic
to keep me from that laundry.

575
00:44:04,381 --> 00:44:06,482
Calm down.

576
00:44:06,517 --> 00:44:09,602
That call I got telling me
Marie was in the hospital...

577
00:44:09,653 --> 00:44:12,221
that wasn't Pinkman.

578
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:14,223
You had my cell number.

579
00:44:14,241 --> 00:44:17,944
You killed ten witnesses
to save your sorry ass.

580
00:44:17,995 --> 00:44:21,564
- Listen to me--
- You bombed a nursing home.

581
00:44:21,582 --> 00:44:25,034
Heisenberg. Heisenberg!

582
00:44:25,068 --> 00:44:27,870
You lying,
two-faced sack of shit.

583
00:44:27,904 --> 00:44:29,872
Hank, look,

584
00:44:29,906 --> 00:44:32,408
I don't know where this is
coming from, Hank, but just--

585
00:44:32,426 --> 00:44:36,429
I swear to Christ,
I will put you under the jail.

586
00:44:36,463 --> 00:44:38,681
Just take a breath, okay?
Just listen to yourself.

587
00:44:38,716 --> 00:44:41,517
These wild accusations--
they could destroy our family.

588
00:44:41,552 --> 00:44:44,353
- And for what?
- Damn, like you give a shit about family!

589
00:44:50,944 --> 00:44:53,446
Hank, my cancer is back.

590
00:44:54,448 --> 00:44:56,783
Good.

591
00:44:56,817 --> 00:44:59,118
Rot, you son of a bitch.

592
00:45:00,154 --> 00:45:02,155
I'm sorry you feel that way.

593
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,908
I wanna beat this thing.
I do.

594
00:45:05,942 --> 00:45:09,545
I'm back on chemo,
and I am fighting like hell.

595
00:45:11,548 --> 00:45:13,800
But the truth is in six months,

596
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:17,503
you won't have
someone to prosecute.

597
00:45:19,339 --> 00:45:21,257
But even--

598
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:24,060
even if somehow

599
00:45:24,094 --> 00:45:27,764
you were able
to convince anyone

600
00:45:27,798 --> 00:45:30,516
I was capable
of doing these things,

601
00:45:30,567 --> 00:45:33,402
you and I both know

602
00:45:33,437 --> 00:45:36,439
I would never see
the inside of a jail cell.

603
00:45:41,478 --> 00:45:45,748
I'm a dying man
who runs a car wash.

604
00:45:45,783 --> 00:45:50,036
My right hand to God,
that is all that I am.

605
00:45:55,092 --> 00:45:57,627
What's the point?

606
00:46:01,832 --> 00:46:05,218
Have Skyler
bring the kids here,

607
00:46:05,269 --> 00:46:07,770
and then we'll talk.

608
00:46:11,441 --> 00:46:14,844
That is not going to happen.

609
00:46:19,983 --> 00:46:22,485
I don't know who you are.

610
00:46:24,488 --> 00:46:27,490
I don't even know
who I'm talking to.

611
00:46:31,211 --> 00:46:34,413
If that's true,

612
00:46:34,464 --> 00:46:38,033
if you don't know who I am...

613
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,390
then maybe your best course...

614
00:46:46,393 --> 00:46:49,428
would be to tread lightly.

615
00:47:03,973 --> 00:47:08,000

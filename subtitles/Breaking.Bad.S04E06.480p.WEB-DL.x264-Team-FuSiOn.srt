1
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:50,880
No, no, no!

2
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,184
Hey. Chh-chh.

Oh...

14
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,032
Mmm.

15
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,472
Ohh...

16
00:04:25,504 --> 00:04:27,391
Morning.

17
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,536
Afternoon.

18
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:32,608
Oh. Really? Jesus.

19
00:04:33,696 --> 00:04:36,192
You shouldn't
have let me sleep.

20
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:37,920
You needed it.

21
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,096
Ohh...

22
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,056
Skyler, I don't
entirely remember

23
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,368
what happened last night.

24
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,776
I mean, if...

25
00:04:55,808 --> 00:04:57,184
I said something--

26
00:04:57,216 --> 00:04:59,712
Did you know
this Gale Boetticher person?

27
00:05:01,888 --> 00:05:04,096
Skyler, I can't even
focus. I don't--

28
00:05:04,128 --> 00:05:06,176
Gale Boetticher.

29
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,936
Did you know him?

30
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,992
Ha.

31
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:11,296
Oh, my God. What?

32
00:05:11,328 --> 00:05:14,144
What exactly
did I say last night?

33
00:05:14,176 --> 00:05:16,832
Just enough.

34
00:05:16,864 --> 00:05:19,104
Did you work together?

35
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,296
Who killed him?

36
00:05:28,576 --> 00:05:31,360
Was it the people you work for?

37
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:34,624
Definitely not.

38
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:36,160
Was it somebody who--

39
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:39,872
At one point...

40
00:05:39,904 --> 00:05:42,976
might want to do
the same to you?

41
00:05:45,696 --> 00:05:48,384
I seriously doubt it.

42
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,472
No.

43
00:05:52,096 --> 00:05:53,568
Ohh...

44
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,848
God.

45
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,160
Oh, God.

46
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:10,272
I think I know what happened
last night, Walt.

47
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:13,376
Mm. I know exactly
what happened last night.

48
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:14,688
I drank too much wine.

49
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,336
You told Hank

50
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:20,928
that the man he was looking for

51
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,208
might still be out there,

52
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,648
that it might not be this--

53
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,800
Mm.

54
00:06:24,832 --> 00:06:26,464
Boetticher after all.

55
00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:30,016
And I was up all night

56
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,088
wondering why you would
say that to him.

57
00:06:33,152 --> 00:06:34,624
Because I was drunk, Skyler.

58
00:06:34,656 --> 00:06:35,744
No, but then--

59
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:36,896
But then I was remembering

60
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:38,592
your black eye--

61
00:06:38,624 --> 00:06:41,760
Your, uh, business disagreement

62
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,136
that you don't
want to talk about.

63
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,104
I don't want to talk
about any of this ever.

64
00:06:47,136 --> 00:06:49,664
The firewall, all right?

65
00:06:49,696 --> 00:06:51,616
Church and state.

66
00:06:51,648 --> 00:06:54,464
That's how we need
to approach this thing.

67
00:06:57,728 --> 00:06:59,200
And then I remembered
the message

68
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:00,800
you left me the other day...

69
00:07:02,304 --> 00:07:04,288
when you said you loved me.

70
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:10,432
When I heard that,
I thought that maybe...

71
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:11,712
you-- I don't know--

72
00:07:11,744 --> 00:07:15,648
That you were regretting
what's happened between us,

73
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,088
and I get that.

74
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,232
After last night, I--

75
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,592
Walt, I think you're scared.

76
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:30,240
I think that message
was some...

77
00:07:30,272 --> 00:07:31,968
kind of goodbye.

78
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:33,088
Oh, Skyler.

79
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,200
I think last night
was a cry for help.

80
00:07:35,232 --> 00:07:36,544
Oh, Jesus.

81
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:38,112
Cry for help.

82
00:07:38,144 --> 00:07:41,120
I think some part of you
wants Hank to catch you.

83
00:07:41,152 --> 00:07:43,264
Wow!

84
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,600
That is just--

85
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:46,880
That is--

86
00:07:46,912 --> 00:07:48,992
That is it.

87
00:07:49,024 --> 00:07:51,040
Exactly, yes.

88
00:07:51,072 --> 00:07:53,344
You're like
Dr. Joyce Brothers here.

89
00:07:53,376 --> 00:07:54,720
God!

90
00:07:54,752 --> 00:07:55,968
If he caught you,

91
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,408
at least this would
all be over.

92
00:07:57,472 --> 00:07:59,296
Oh, yeah. That's
a tremendous weight

93
00:07:59,328 --> 00:08:01,280
just lifted off of me.

94
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:03,744
Now I--
I understand myself.

95
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:05,472
Thank you. Thank you.

96
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:06,784
Walt.

97
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:08,416
I've said it before.

98
00:08:08,448 --> 00:08:12,032
If you are in danger,
we go to the police.

99
00:08:12,064 --> 00:08:14,176
Oh, no. I don't want to
hear about the police.

100
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,248
I do not say that lightly.

101
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,840
I know what it could do
to this family.

102
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:22,528
But if it's the only
real choice we have--

103
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,064
If it's either that--
Oh...

104
00:08:24,096 --> 00:08:26,112
or your getting shot
when you open your front door--

105
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:27,776
I don't want to hear
about the police.

106
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:30,368
You're not some
hardened criminal, Walt.

107
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,352
You're in over your head.

108
00:08:32,384 --> 00:08:34,208
That's what we tell them.
That's the truth.

109
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,456
That is not the truth.

110
00:08:35,488 --> 00:08:37,024
Of course it is.

111
00:08:37,056 --> 00:08:40,544
A schoolteacher, cancer,
desperate for money?

112
00:08:40,576 --> 00:08:41,504
Okay, we're done here.

113
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:42,560
Roped into working for--

114
00:08:42,592 --> 00:08:43,744
Unable to even quit?

115
00:08:43,776 --> 00:08:46,176
You told me that
yourself, Walt.

116
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,736
Jesus, what was I thinking?

117
00:08:48,768 --> 00:08:50,240
Walt, please.

118
00:08:50,272 --> 00:08:51,872
Let's both of us

119
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:54,208
stop trying to justify
this whole thing

120
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,640
and admit you're in danger.

121
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,544
Who are you talking to
right now?

122
00:09:03,136 --> 00:09:05,376
Who is it you think you see?

123
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,560
Do you know how much
I make a year?

124
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:13,280
I mean, even if I told you,
you wouldn't believe it.

125
00:09:13,312 --> 00:09:14,656
Do you know what would happen

126
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:17,216
if I suddenly decided
to stop going in to work?

127
00:09:17,248 --> 00:09:19,136
A business big enough

128
00:09:19,168 --> 00:09:20,544
that it could be listed
on the NASDAQ

129
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:22,944
goes belly-up, disappears.

130
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:25,792
It ceases to exist
without me. No.

131
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:28,736
You clearly don't know
who you're talking to,

132
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:29,920
so let me clue you in.

133
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:32,608
I am not in danger, Skyler.

134
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,208
I am the danger.

135
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,064
A guy opens his door
and gets shot,

136
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:37,440
and you think that of me?

137
00:09:37,472 --> 00:09:38,560
No.

138
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:40,928
I am the one who knocks.

139
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,504
Ohh...

140
00:10:21,824 --> 00:10:23,424
Look, I was--

141
00:10:39,008 --> 00:10:40,096
Skyler?

142
00:11:02,272 --> 00:11:03,296
Here we are.

143
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:05,184
Just like you left it.

144
00:11:07,904 --> 00:11:09,856
And where is your pretty wife?

145
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:14,016
She has other business
to attend to.

146
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,736
Well, like I say to her,

147
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:20,320
place is as is.
Understand?

148
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:23,648
Yes, I understand.

149
00:11:23,712 --> 00:11:25,664
Good. Good.

150
00:11:25,696 --> 00:11:28,352
I don't want her coming back
with more demands.

151
00:11:28,384 --> 00:11:31,456
She-- She gave me hard time
when we settled on price.

152
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,176
We're all on
the same page, Bogdan.

153
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,976
So here's everything you need.

154
00:11:39,008 --> 00:11:40,512
I keep very good files.

155
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:42,464
Thank you.

156
00:11:42,496 --> 00:11:45,152
So you are the boss now, huh?

157
00:11:49,184 --> 00:11:50,752
You think you're ready?

158
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:55,232
Yes, I-- I think so.

159
00:11:57,856 --> 00:12:00,384
Being boss is tough.

160
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:04,448
I know you think
I was hard on you,

161
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,400
but you'll learn.

162
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:10,016
Being in charge is not easy.

163
00:12:10,048 --> 00:12:11,776
It takes hard work.

164
00:12:11,808 --> 00:12:13,952
You've seen me work hard,
Bogdan.

165
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:17,376
Yeah? I don't know.

166
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:19,360
Not so much, maybe.

167
00:12:19,392 --> 00:12:21,952
But maybe,
when you are the boss,

168
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:24,704
uh, you will
just keep your feet up

169
00:12:24,736 --> 00:12:26,368
and relax.

170
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,352
Mm.

171
00:12:28,384 --> 00:12:31,840
The real important thing,

172
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:34,304
and not everyone knows this is,

173
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,064
is to be tough.

174
00:12:38,144 --> 00:12:41,984
A boss has to be tough.

175
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:45,248
Has to say no to people.

176
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:51,616
Has to make cashiers
wipe down cars,

177
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:55,168
even if they don't want to.

178
00:12:57,344 --> 00:13:00,192
Can you be tough, Walter?

179
00:13:04,096 --> 00:13:06,624
I-- I'm sure
you can handle.

180
00:13:06,656 --> 00:13:08,544
And if not,

181
00:13:08,576 --> 00:13:12,096
you can always
call your wife, huh?

182
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:22,592
Always sticky. No problem.

183
00:13:25,376 --> 00:13:27,104
As is.

184
00:13:42,048 --> 00:13:43,200
Who'd have thought

185
00:13:43,232 --> 00:13:46,816
that someday I would be
handing these keys to you?

186
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,920
Many years. Almost forgot.

187
00:14:11,488 --> 00:14:12,736
Bogdan.

188
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:18,304
As is.

189
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:34,016
Thank you.

190
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,488
You okay there?

191
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,912
Fine.

192
00:16:18,112 --> 00:16:20,672
It's night.
I'm not using.

193
00:16:29,536 --> 00:16:31,488
Eat something.

194
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:06,976
Yeah.

195
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,752
That's right.
Both of them.

196
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:13,088
Uh--

197
00:17:14,656 --> 00:17:16,160
I'm on my way.

198
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,160
You need any help?

199
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:24,224
No.

200
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,720
You want me to call her back?

201
00:17:46,752 --> 00:17:49,152
No. No.

202
00:17:51,776 --> 00:17:53,984
But what exactly did she say?

203
00:17:54,048 --> 00:17:56,096
Uh, exactly.

204
00:17:57,184 --> 00:17:58,784
Just, you know,

205
00:17:58,816 --> 00:18:02,272
she asked if I was okay
and not to worry.

206
00:18:02,304 --> 00:18:04,480
Like that.

207
00:18:04,512 --> 00:18:05,696
Hmm.

208
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,344
Any, uh, rough timetable
on this thing,

209
00:18:09,376 --> 00:18:11,904
or as to when she's
coming home?

210
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,768
Uh, it's-- It's about
the gambling, right?

211
00:18:19,328 --> 00:18:22,784
Well, it's--
It's kind of hard to--

212
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:24,608
She-- She can't understand.

213
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,360
It-- It-- It's not like you're
doing this on purpose.

214
00:18:27,392 --> 00:18:28,672
You can't help it.

215
00:18:30,368 --> 00:18:32,416
It's no that simple.

216
00:18:32,448 --> 00:18:34,112
Look, you have a disease.

217
00:18:34,144 --> 00:18:37,952
It-- It's like you're
an alcoholic, right?

218
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,744
No, it's not. Not at all.

219
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:42,240
Yes, it is.
I read online.

220
00:18:42,272 --> 00:18:44,480
She's not even allowed
to be mad at you,

221
00:18:44,512 --> 00:18:47,360
and she can't be mad at you
about the cancer, can she?

222
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:50,144
No, son, these are two
very different things.

223
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:53,600
Not really. Gambling
addiction is a sickness.

224
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,912
- You c--
- Listen.

225
00:18:54,976 --> 00:18:57,920
What is going on with me
is not about some disease.

226
00:18:57,952 --> 00:18:59,072
It's about choices--

227
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,960
Choices that I have made,

228
00:19:00,992 --> 00:19:03,840
choices I stand by.

229
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:15,776
You're not moving
back in, are you?

230
00:19:23,552 --> 00:19:24,576
No.

231
00:19:30,912 --> 00:19:31,872
Hey.

232
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,728
You know what?

233
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,872
School can wait.

234
00:19:35,904 --> 00:19:40,000
Why don't we
take a little detour?

235
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:43,328
What kind of detour?

236
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:46,272
You'll see.

237
00:19:57,568 --> 00:20:00,832
I think it's time
we got you your own car.

238
00:20:00,864 --> 00:20:02,112
What do you think?

239
00:20:03,872 --> 00:20:04,864
What?

240
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:10,144
I-- I think if you're
going to buy me off...

241
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,088
buy me off.

242
00:20:35,872 --> 00:20:37,664
Wow.

243
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,424
It's amazing.
It's amazing.

244
00:20:39,456 --> 00:20:41,280
Ah, it's good-looking.

245
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,696
I'm glad you like it.

246
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,552
I-- I do, Thank you, Dad.

247
00:20:47,584 --> 00:20:48,896
All right.
You're welcome.

248
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,584
So you're here.

249
00:21:07,616 --> 00:21:09,504
Yeah.

250
00:21:13,216 --> 00:21:15,616
You're actually here?
To work?

251
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,304
Yeah, man.

252
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:19,776
Jesus.

253
00:21:19,808 --> 00:21:20,800
Jesse.

254
00:21:22,752 --> 00:21:24,128
Come here.

255
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,304
All right, I need an update.

256
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,392
Update on what?

257
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,048
An update on these
little field trips

258
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,904
that you've been
taking with Mike.

259
00:21:31,936 --> 00:21:34,496
I told you already.
We pick up money,

260
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:36,256
check on things,
stuff like that.

261
00:21:37,728 --> 00:21:39,424
And you're his bodyguard,
right?

262
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,784
But what?
That's what you said.

263
00:21:42,848 --> 00:21:46,048
I said I guarded him,
like backup,

264
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,296
like a second set of eyes.

265
00:21:47,328 --> 00:21:49,312
Everybody needs backup, right?

266
00:21:50,848 --> 00:21:52,224
And this has to be you.

267
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,752
It can't be...
I don't know.

268
00:21:54,784 --> 00:21:58,208
Tyrus or any of those
couple dozen muscle heads

269
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,808
that Gus has working for him?

270
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,176
It has to be Jesse Pinkman.

271
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,552
Why?

272
00:22:03,584 --> 00:22:05,184
What is there,
something about you

273
00:22:05,216 --> 00:22:06,432
that I don't know?

274
00:22:06,464 --> 00:22:08,704
Are you a former Navy SEAL?

275
00:22:08,736 --> 00:22:10,176
Do you have to have your hands

276
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,424
registered as lethal weapons?

277
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,832
Register this.

278
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:16,320
All I'm saying is that do you
not even question this?

279
00:22:16,352 --> 00:22:17,760
Do you really believe

280
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:19,936
that you mean anything
to these people?

281
00:22:19,968 --> 00:22:21,408
And I'm not trying
to be insulting.

282
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,264
I'm just trying to make you
see things clearly.

283
00:22:23,296 --> 00:22:25,536
I see they can't
outright kill me,

284
00:22:25,568 --> 00:22:27,008
but they don't want me
getting high.

285
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,824
I see this
thing probably started

286
00:22:29,856 --> 00:22:31,680
as Gus getting Mike
to babysit me.

287
00:22:31,712 --> 00:22:33,632
But you know what?

288
00:22:33,664 --> 00:22:36,640
I saved Mike
from getting robbed,

289
00:22:36,704 --> 00:22:38,912
even killed, maybe.

290
00:22:38,944 --> 00:22:42,304
So maybe I'm not
such a loser after all.

291
00:22:45,408 --> 00:22:46,528
I mean, what if it--

292
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,000
Oh, God.

293
00:22:57,216 --> 00:22:58,240
I mean, what if--

294
00:22:58,272 --> 00:23:00,544
What if it's all just a setup?

295
00:23:00,576 --> 00:23:03,616
- What? - What if this
robbery that you stopped

296
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,056
wasn't even real?

297
00:23:05,088 --> 00:23:06,816
I mean, think about it.

298
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:08,960
Your first day out
guarding Mike.

299
00:23:08,992 --> 00:23:11,392
He steps out for one second,
and what happens?

300
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:13,056
You immediately get robbed.

301
00:23:13,088 --> 00:23:14,496
You are such an asshole.

302
00:23:14,528 --> 00:23:17,088
Keep your friends close,
keep your enemies closer.

303
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,368
Like you said,

304
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,672
Gus can't kill you
because of me.

305
00:23:20,704 --> 00:23:22,144
He knows I won't stand for it.

306
00:23:22,176 --> 00:23:24,608
He needs me, and he hates
the fact that he needs me,

307
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,304
so what does he do?
He goes to work

308
00:23:26,336 --> 00:23:28,064
driving a wedge
between you and me.

309
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:29,152
You're an asshole.

310
00:23:29,184 --> 00:23:30,304
If you'd been there,

311
00:23:30,336 --> 00:23:31,616
you'd know it wasn't a setup.

312
00:23:31,648 --> 00:23:33,664
Wait a minute. How long
did those guys chase you?

313
00:23:33,728 --> 00:23:36,192
Huh? Because the way
you describe it,

314
00:23:36,224 --> 00:23:38,816
they gave up pretty damn easy.

315
00:23:38,848 --> 00:23:40,832
No, no. This--

316
00:23:40,864 --> 00:23:43,840
This whole thing,
all of this--

317
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,840
It's all about me.

318
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:36,000
Hello.

319
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,736
Uh, who is it? Hang on.

320
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,584
Yeah.

321
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,376
I'll be right up.

322
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,056
What?

323
00:24:53,088 --> 00:24:55,264
I got to go.

324
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,856
Well, am I supposed to
clean all this on my own?

325
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,712
Hey!

326
00:25:08,224 --> 00:25:09,376
God.

327
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,128
Ah.

328
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,272
<i>Buenos días,</i> ladies.

329
00:25:30,304 --> 00:25:32,576
<i>Buenos días.</i>
Uh, do you speak English?

330
00:25:32,608 --> 00:25:34,112
<i>¿Se habla inglés?</i> No. No.

331
00:25:34,144 --> 00:25:35,392
No. Okay, uh...

332
00:25:35,424 --> 00:25:36,960
<i>yo-- Yo,</i> uh--

333
00:25:36,992 --> 00:25:38,976
Help, help--

334
00:25:39,008 --> 00:25:40,544
Uh, ayon-- Ayonda--

335
00:25:40,576 --> 00:25:42,880

00:25:53,536 --> 00:25:54,816
No, no, no. <i>Es bueno.</i>

342
00:25:54,848 --> 00:25:57,056
Uh... Uh, <i>por favor,</i>
<i>por favor.</i>

343
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,592
<i>Atrás, atrás, ¿sí?</i>

344
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:00,544
<i>Muy bueno, muy bueno.</i>

345
00:26:03,744 --> 00:26:05,600
Yes, <i>muy bueno.</i>

346
00:26:05,632 --> 00:26:07,008
- It's just this--
- No.

347
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,704
No, no, no, no.
<i>No podemos.</i>

348
00:26:08,736 --> 00:26:09,696
<i>No podemos.</i>

349
00:26:09,728 --> 00:26:10,688
<i>Lo siento.</i>

350
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,320
No, no, no, no.
<i>Es no problema.</i>

351
00:26:12,384 --> 00:26:13,952
<i>Un momento, un momento,</i>
<i>un momento.</i>

352
00:26:13,984 --> 00:26:14,944
<i>No problema.</i>

353
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,120
No, no, ladies.

354
00:26:21,152 --> 00:26:22,272
<i>Un momento, un momento.</i>

355
00:26:22,304 --> 00:26:23,744
<i>Un momento, un momento.</i>

00:26:23,776 --> 00:26:27,232
<i>Yo necesito ayuda,</i> uh...

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,032
<i>No, no podemos.</i>
<i>Muy fácil.</i>

359
00:26:33,504 --> 00:26:35,360
Let me see. Let me see.
<i>Un momento.</i>

360
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,056
I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you what.

361
00:26:37,088 --> 00:26:38,240
Look, look, look.

362
00:26:38,272 --> 00:26:40,384
Universal language.
<i>Dinero. ¿Dinero?</i>

363
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:42,272
No.
<i>¿Para usted?</i>

364
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,424
<i>Sí, sí, sí.</i>

365
00:26:43,456 --> 00:26:44,992
<i>Para usted, sí.</i>
<i>Para usted.</i>

366
00:26:45,024 --> 00:26:47,136
There's one for you.
Yes, <i>sí.</i>

367
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:49,952
<i>Presidente</i> Grant.
Very important man.

368
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:53,504
<i>Sí. Para usted, sí, sí.</i>

369
00:26:53,536 --> 00:26:54,944
And <i>más dinero--</i>

370
00:26:54,976 --> 00:26:56,608
<i>Más dinero</i> after--

371
00:27:00,608 --> 00:27:01,984
Are we good?

372
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,040
I think we're good.

373
00:27:03,104 --> 00:27:04,128
I think we listened to you.

374
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,536
Please. <i>Por favor.</i>
<i>Por favor.</i>

375
00:27:05,568 --> 00:27:06,528
<i>Vamos.</i>

376
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,024
<i>Dos horas máximo, ¿sí?</i>

377
00:27:09,056 --> 00:27:10,816
Please. <i>Por favor.</i>
<i>Por favor.</i>

378
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,800
Yes.

379
00:27:12,832 --> 00:27:15,072
<i>Iguales!</i>

380
00:29:53,856 --> 00:29:55,104
What's the deal?

381
00:29:57,472 --> 00:30:02,112
Uh, the deal is we're
watching that house.

382
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,792
A couple down on the left
with the tree in the front.

383
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:08,096
Yeah? What for?

384
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,912
A little birdie told me
there's some guys in there

385
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,672
that have 3 pounds
of our product

386
00:30:12,704 --> 00:30:14,048
which they're selling

387
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,928
and which they sure as hell
didn't get from us.

388
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,992
So what's the plan?

389
00:30:22,496 --> 00:30:24,224
I just told you.

390
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,136
We sit here
and watch that house

391
00:30:27,168 --> 00:30:30,176
until one of our entrepreneurs
pops his head out.

392
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:31,648
Then we ask a few questions

393
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,504
and get our property back.

394
00:30:35,104 --> 00:30:38,048
Why don't you just go
break the door down

395
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,024
and pistol whip those bitches
and show them who's boss?

396
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:44,096
Because a little birdie
also told me

397
00:30:44,128 --> 00:30:46,176
these guys are heavily
into the product

398
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:48,224
and most likely armed.

399
00:30:48,256 --> 00:30:51,520
Now, what you may not
know about meth heads--

400
00:30:52,544 --> 00:30:54,176
Maybe you do--

401
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,928
They're kind of unpredictable.

402
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,040
I don't care for unpredictable,

403
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,512
so we wait.

404
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,480
Sorry to burst
your bubble, kid,

405
00:31:04,512 --> 00:31:07,008
but that's 90% of the job.

406
00:31:08,224 --> 00:31:09,440
Don't worry.

407
00:31:09,472 --> 00:31:11,584
I brought sandwiches.

408
00:31:14,848 --> 00:31:17,472
Yes, sir. Ha.

409
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,416
Uh...

410
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,264
pimiento cheese.
How does that sound?

411
00:31:30,592 --> 00:31:32,704
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

412
00:31:32,736 --> 00:31:34,208
So they're selling, right?

413
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,320
Maybe I'm looking to buy.

414
00:31:44,704 --> 00:31:45,984
Who the hell are you?

415
00:31:46,016 --> 00:31:47,200
Tucker!

416
00:31:47,232 --> 00:31:48,512
I'm, uh, here to buy.

417
00:31:48,544 --> 00:31:49,984
Tucker! Will you
shut the damn door?

418
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,040
- Not my question.
- Tucker!

419
00:31:51,072 --> 00:31:52,192
Uh, my name's Diesel.

420
00:31:52,224 --> 00:31:53,376
Tucker!

421
00:31:53,408 --> 00:31:55,328
Thought you maybe had
some of the blue?

422
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,408
Tucker!
Shut the door, Tucker!

423
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,464
- I'm just, uh--
- Tucker!

424
00:31:58,496 --> 00:31:59,904
Just looking for a teenth.

425
00:31:59,936 --> 00:32:02,048
- Tucker!
- Yo. Come on.

426
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,264
- Tucker!
- Help a brother out.

427
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,960
Tucker, will you
shut the damn door?

428
00:32:04,992 --> 00:32:06,944
We don't sell to strangers.

429
00:32:06,976 --> 00:32:08,064
Tucker!

430
00:32:08,096 --> 00:32:09,536
Get off the porch, asshole.

431
00:32:09,568 --> 00:32:11,008
Tucker, will you shut the door?

432
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,480
All right already!
Jesus!

433
00:32:12,512 --> 00:32:13,600
Tucker!

434
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:49,504
Guess we'll go
with Plan A, then.

435
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,432
Flip the trunk, will you?

436
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:08,608
Why?

437
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,624
There's something
in there I need.

438
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,224
And what would that be?

439
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:15,040
I'm getting those pricks
out of that house.

440
00:33:15,072 --> 00:33:17,920
Oh, your first attempt
being such a wild success.

441
00:33:17,952 --> 00:33:21,504
You may know this whole
P.I. sit-in-the-car business,

442
00:33:21,536 --> 00:33:23,488
but I know meth heads.

443
00:34:15,584 --> 00:34:16,832
What are you doing?

444
00:34:18,304 --> 00:34:19,520
Digging.

445
00:34:20,608 --> 00:34:22,048
Why?

446
00:34:23,296 --> 00:34:25,408
Uh, you know why.

447
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,712
How deep are you going?

448
00:34:27,744 --> 00:34:29,152
I don't know.

449
00:34:29,184 --> 00:34:31,712
How deep do you think it is?

450
00:34:35,328 --> 00:34:36,480
Pretty deep.

451
00:34:43,776 --> 00:34:44,864
Hey, uh...

452
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:49,248
you mind taking over
for a minute?

453
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,000
Yeah. Sure.

454
00:35:02,464 --> 00:35:05,728
Hey, uh, mind if I
use your john?

455
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,816
Yeah.

456
00:35:33,696 --> 00:35:34,816
Tucker!

457
00:35:37,216 --> 00:35:38,560
Tucker!

458
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,568
Tucker!

459
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,312
Who the hell are you?

460
00:35:53,344 --> 00:35:54,848
I-- Hey.

461
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,904
Who the hell are you?

462
00:35:55,936 --> 00:35:57,344
Hey, I'm, uh--

463
00:35:57,376 --> 00:35:58,720
I'm a friend of Tucker's.

464
00:35:58,752 --> 00:36:00,096
What do you want?

465
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,568
I just, uh--

466
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,576
Just want to-- Just want
to buy some of the blue.

467
00:36:04,608 --> 00:36:05,920
It's not for sale.

468
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,592
Well, I know you were
selling it earlier, so--

469
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,224
Yeah?
How do you know that?

470
00:36:12,256 --> 00:36:14,112
Uh, Tucker told me.

471
00:36:14,144 --> 00:36:15,000
Yeah, well,
Tucker needs to learn

472
00:36:16,032 --> 00:36:17,792
to keep his damn mouth shut.

473
00:36:17,824 --> 00:36:18,976
Tucker!

474
00:36:19,008 --> 00:36:20,128
Tucker?

475
00:36:21,856 --> 00:36:23,712
So, uh...

476
00:36:23,744 --> 00:36:25,280
you going to help me out?

477
00:36:25,312 --> 00:36:27,648
Don't have enough for all
of Tucker's asshole friends.

478
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,856
Tucker!

479
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,160
Yo, I-- I think he's outside.

480
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:33,184
Why don't you just--

481
00:36:33,216 --> 00:36:34,400
Why don't you go outside--

482
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,032
Tucker! Tucker!

483
00:36:36,064 --> 00:36:39,616
Hey, hey. Let's go--
Let's go find Tucker.

484
00:36:39,648 --> 00:36:41,888
Okay?
Let's go outside and--

485
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,336
I don't have enough
for you, all right?

486
00:36:46,368 --> 00:36:49,152
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

487
00:36:49,184 --> 00:36:51,424
Forget it. Okay?

488
00:36:51,456 --> 00:36:52,832
I don't want to--

489
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,824
I don't want to start
any trouble.

490
00:36:53,856 --> 00:36:55,232
Trouble? Trouble?

491
00:36:55,264 --> 00:36:56,512
What does that mean, trouble?

492
00:36:56,544 --> 00:36:58,752
No, no. I'm just saying
we're cool, okay?

493
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:00,000
We're-- We're-- We're good.

494
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,016
What? You can't know that.

495
00:37:02,048 --> 00:37:03,200
What does that mean?

496
00:37:03,232 --> 00:37:05,696
What-- Don't put thoughts
in my head!

497
00:37:05,728 --> 00:37:07,680
You don't put
thoughts in my head!

498
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,992
Absolutely. You're right.

499
00:37:09,024 --> 00:37:10,048
You're right.

500
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,200
Tucker.

501
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,504
You--

502
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,608
Uh...

503
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,360
<i>muchas,</i> <i>muchas gracias, amigas.</i>

504
00:37:51,424 --> 00:37:53,568
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>
Here you go.

505
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,784
Oh, <i>gracias.</i>

506
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:57,120
María, Vernita, Lucía, <i>gracias.</i>

507
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:58,688
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

508
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,160
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

509
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:03,072
<i>Ustedes,</i> uh, residar
<i>¿cerca aquí?</i>

510
00:38:06,496 --> 00:38:08,320
I missed that one.
I'm sure it was good.

511
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:12,160
<i>Damas. Vengan conmigo.</i>

512
00:38:18,848 --> 00:38:21,920
Uh, what-- Wait a minute.
Where are you taking them?

513
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,032
Come on, Tyrus,
what are you doing?

514
00:38:24,064 --> 00:38:26,144
I'm putting them on a bus.

515
00:38:26,176 --> 00:38:27,904
Why? What bus?

516
00:38:27,936 --> 00:38:29,440
One that takes them
back to Honduras.

517
00:38:29,472 --> 00:38:31,392
Hey, wait a second.
Wait a minute.

518
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,840
Th-Th-This was my idea.

519
00:38:35,872 --> 00:38:37,216
Don't punish them.

520
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,000
You tell Gus
to blame me, not them.

521
00:38:40,032 --> 00:38:41,856
He does.

522
00:39:06,912 --> 00:39:08,352
Give us a minute, will you?

523
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,368
We won't be too long.

524
00:39:31,008 --> 00:39:33,824
The crew that hit our truck
gave away the cargo

525
00:39:33,856 --> 00:39:36,032
to a couple of local nobodies.

526
00:39:36,096 --> 00:39:37,504
Very disciplined, though,

527
00:39:37,536 --> 00:39:39,744
not keeping anything
for themselves.

528
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:43,072
It was all about
sending a message,

529
00:39:43,136 --> 00:39:45,376
which they did, literally.

530
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,832
It was written
on the bucket lid.

531
00:39:48,864 --> 00:39:50,752
"Ready to talk?"

532
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:53,920
That, I believe,
is the English translation.

533
00:39:57,216 --> 00:40:00,608
I know you're not really
asking for advice,

534
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,528
but let me hire 10,
15 more good operators,

535
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,512
and we hit them back,
hit them hard,

536
00:40:08,544 --> 00:40:09,600
hit them where they live.

537
00:40:09,632 --> 00:40:11,488
No.

538
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,400
This war stays cold for now.

539
00:40:18,656 --> 00:40:21,216
What about their message?
What's the answer?

540
00:40:24,992 --> 00:40:26,400
Set up a meeting.

541
00:40:26,432 --> 00:40:28,512
Let's see
what they have to say.

542
00:40:31,072 --> 00:40:33,152
How did he do today?

543
00:40:55,264 --> 00:40:57,376
I hear you can handle yourself.

544
00:40:58,816 --> 00:41:00,000
I guess.

545
00:41:01,536 --> 00:41:03,264
Good night.

546
00:41:03,296 --> 00:41:05,120
Uh, excuse me.

547
00:41:07,456 --> 00:41:09,344
Why me?

548
00:41:10,976 --> 00:41:13,536
I like to think
I see things in people.

549
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,392
Slow down. The car
is not going anywhere.

550
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,224
Mom.

551
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,496
Hey, sweetheart.

552
00:41:50,528 --> 00:41:51,648
Hi.

553
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,736
Hey.

554
00:41:54,752 --> 00:41:57,632
Whoo. Ah.
There you go.

555
00:41:57,664 --> 00:41:59,616
Did you see
what's in the driveway?

556
00:41:59,648 --> 00:42:02,848
Uh, yeah, I saw.

557
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,904
Hey.

558
00:42:07,328 --> 00:42:09,344
So that's yours, huh?

559
00:42:09,376 --> 00:42:12,224
Yeah.
Dad got it for me.

560
00:42:12,256 --> 00:42:14,528
That was very nice of him.

561
00:42:14,592 --> 00:42:16,480
Yeah.

562
00:42:16,512 --> 00:42:20,096
I-- I know it looks like...

563
00:42:20,128 --> 00:42:24,064
well, awesome,
but it's super safe.

564
00:42:24,096 --> 00:42:25,376
Dad-- Dad made sure.

565
00:42:25,408 --> 00:42:27,872
And I promise to always
go the speed limit

566
00:42:27,904 --> 00:42:30,240
or below, way below.

567
00:42:30,272 --> 00:42:34,272
And it gets great gas mileage.

568
00:42:36,224 --> 00:42:39,904
So Dad said I can take it
around the block a few times.

569
00:42:39,936 --> 00:42:41,120
That okay?

570
00:42:41,152 --> 00:42:43,744
Just around the block.

571
00:42:43,776 --> 00:42:47,200
Yeah.
Just around the block.

572
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:49,408
And be careful, okay?

573
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,464
I will.

574
00:42:51,776 --> 00:42:52,800
Bye.

575
00:42:55,488 --> 00:42:57,696
I-It-- It's really--

576
00:42:57,728 --> 00:42:59,712
It's really great
to have you home, Mom.

577
00:43:06,944 --> 00:43:09,792
Hey, seriously,
be careful, okay?

578
00:43:09,824 --> 00:43:10,816
I will.

579
00:43:10,848 --> 00:43:11,840
Okay.

580
00:43:29,728 --> 00:43:32,416
I guess we should talk.

581
00:43:32,448 --> 00:43:35,136
Oh, I think you said
plenty the other day.

582
00:43:35,168 --> 00:43:39,872
No. Look, about that,
it just--

583
00:43:39,904 --> 00:43:42,656
Did you get the car wash keys?

584
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,472
Um, yes, yes.

585
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,184
Skyler, I may have...

586
00:43:57,216 --> 00:43:59,968
overstated things earlier,

587
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,744
and I'm sorry to be so forward.

588
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,104
But I-- I just--

589
00:44:07,136 --> 00:44:08,992
I want you to know something.

590
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:10,368
I want you to--

591
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,696
I need you to understand

592
00:44:13,728 --> 00:44:15,840
that you are safe.

593
00:44:15,872 --> 00:44:18,624
You, Junior, Holly--

594
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,024
You are completely safe.

595
00:44:22,976 --> 00:44:26,528
Everything that I do--
Everything--

596
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,048
I do it to protect this family.

597
00:44:31,296 --> 00:44:33,536
So buying that car,

598
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,840
that was protecting
your family?

599
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,632
Okay. I, uh--

600
00:44:41,664 --> 00:44:43,104
All right, maybe
it's a little flashy,

601
00:44:43,136 --> 00:44:45,600
but he needed a car,
and--

602
00:44:47,232 --> 00:44:48,544
And I'm his father,

603
00:44:48,576 --> 00:44:54,271
and I should be able
to get what he wants.

604
00:44:54,272 --> 00:44:58,496
It goes back tomorrow.

605
00:44:58,528 --> 00:45:01,408
Skyler, it will crush him.

606
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:07,232
That car directly
contradicts our story.

607
00:45:07,264 --> 00:45:10,944
And if you're so invested
in protecting this family,

608
00:45:10,976 --> 00:45:13,952
it means protecting the story.

609
00:45:13,984 --> 00:45:16,992
What do you think the neighbors
are going to say, Walt?

610
00:45:17,024 --> 00:45:18,752
What about Hank and Marie?

611
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:20,544
How about the IRS?

612
00:45:20,576 --> 00:45:22,880
What were you thinking, Walt?

613
00:45:22,912 --> 00:45:24,416
I was thinking

614
00:45:24,448 --> 00:45:26,848
that I wanted to do
something nice for my son.

615
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:37,632
Look.

616
00:45:40,256 --> 00:45:43,200
I just worry that he'll
blame you for this.

617
00:45:47,424 --> 00:45:49,600
Oh, he will.

618
00:45:49,632 --> 00:45:52,448
Once again,
he'll blame his bitch mother

619
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,040
for taking away what his
loving father has given him,

620
00:45:55,072 --> 00:45:58,304
so thanks for that.

621
00:46:01,408 --> 00:46:03,104
But you know what, Walt?

622
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,624
Someone has to protect
this family

623
00:46:06,656 --> 00:46:26,208
from the man
who protects this family.

Breaking Bad...

00:00:03,158 --> 00:00:04,791
The methylamine...
Jesse and I will be

3
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:06,731
taking our two thirds
and we're selling it.

4
00:00:06,892 --> 00:00:09,449
Full thousand gallons,
not a drop less.

5
00:00:09,591 --> 00:00:12,350
Mike's connection won't buy
unless he gets your share too.

6
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:13,631
Absolutely not.

7
00:00:14,676 --> 00:00:16,817
This deal's going down,
but for some reason,

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,442
I don't trust you alone
with the methylamine.

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,194
I'm gonna have to restrain you.

10
00:00:23,738 --> 00:00:27,162
You get your five millions, we
both do, and he gets his methylamine!

11
00:00:27,276 --> 00:00:28,468
Is that true, Walter?

12
00:00:28,574 --> 00:00:29,925
Everybody wins.

14
00:00:52,923 --> 00:00:54,841
[Jesse] There.

15
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,011
That's them.

16
00:01:09,406 --> 00:01:12,108
[Sighs] Your play, Walter.

17
00:01:12,142 --> 00:01:14,143
You're on your own.

18
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:31,394
Looks like you're about 1,000
gallons light here, Mike.

19
00:01:31,428 --> 00:01:33,396
Where's the juice?

20
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,732
The methylamine isn't coming.

21
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:40,203
Why is that?

22
00:01:40,237 --> 00:01:42,171
And who the hell are you?

23
00:01:42,206 --> 00:01:43,673
I'm the man who's keeping it.

24
00:01:43,707 --> 00:01:46,509
What the hell's this?

25
00:01:46,527 --> 00:01:49,195
We had an agreement, right?
We got our deal.

26
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,181
So where's the tank, Mike?
Mike doesn't know where it is.

27
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:55,652
Only I do. And you're dealing
with me now, not him.

28
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:57,853
Why don't you just cut
to what it is you want,

29
00:01:57,871 --> 00:02:00,022
or what you think is gonna
happen here, all right?

30
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,825
'Cause we're gonna get
what we came for.

31
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:06,195
That 1,000 gallons of methylamine
is worth more in my hands

32
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:08,881
than it is in yours or anyone
else's, for that matter.

33
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,884
But I need distribution.

34
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,387
[Chuckles] Distribution.

35
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:16,372
That's right.

36
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,875
So if you agree
to give up your cook

37
00:02:19,893 --> 00:02:22,729
and sell my product instead,

38
00:02:22,763 --> 00:02:25,214
I'll give you 35 percent
of the take.

39
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:28,884
35 percent?
Wow. Are you kidding me?

40
00:02:28,902 --> 00:02:32,221
35-- Mike, please tell
me this is a joke.

41
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,608
You know how far we had to stick our
necks out to get our hands on this cash?

42
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,393
And why the hell
would we want you?

43
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:39,412
You realize we have
our own operation, right?

44
00:02:39,446 --> 00:02:42,081
I know all about
your operation.

45
00:02:42,116 --> 00:02:45,501
My partners here tell me
that you produce a meth

46
00:02:45,536 --> 00:02:48,955
that's 70% pure,
if you're lucky.

47
00:02:49,006 --> 00:02:53,209
What I produce
is 99.1% pure.

48
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:54,744
So?

49
00:02:57,715 --> 00:03:01,934
So... it's grade school T-Ball

50
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:04,604
versus the New York Yankees.

51
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:08,307
Yours is, uh, just some tepid,

52
00:03:08,358 --> 00:03:11,594
off-brand,
generic cola.

53
00:03:11,612 --> 00:03:15,598
What I'm making
is classic Coke.

54
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:18,367
All right. Okay.

55
00:03:18,402 --> 00:03:20,319
So, um, [Clears throat]

56
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,622
if we just waste you
right here,

57
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:24,791
right now,
and leave you in the desert,

58
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:27,376
then there is no more Coke
on the market, right?

59
00:03:27,411 --> 00:03:30,129
See how that works?
There's only us.

60
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:34,116
Do you really wanna live
in a world without Coca Cola?

61
00:03:44,595 --> 00:03:47,730
My partner tells me
that your crew

62
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:50,650
switched to a P2P cook
because of our success.

63
00:03:50,684 --> 00:03:53,019
You dye your meth
with food coloring

64
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,687
to make it look like mine.

65
00:03:54,738 --> 00:03:59,158
You already ape my product
at every turn.

66
00:03:59,193 --> 00:04:00,943
But now...

67
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:03,362
you have the opportunity
to sell it yourself.

68
00:04:03,413 --> 00:04:05,414
I need you to listen to me.

69
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:07,416
We're not gonna
give up this deal

70
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:10,536
to be your errand boys,
do you understand?

71
00:04:10,587 --> 00:04:12,538
For what?

72
00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:14,874
To watch a bunch of junkies
get a better high?

73
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:18,594
A better high
means customers pay more.

74
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,016
A higher purity
means a greater yield.

75
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:27,336
That's 130 million dollars
a profit

76
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:31,357
that isn't being pissed away
by some substandard cook.

77
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:34,227
Now you listen to me.

78
00:04:34,278 --> 00:04:36,512
You've got the greatest
meth cook in a--

79
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,564
No, the two

80
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:41,150
greatest meth cooks
in America right here,

81
00:04:41,184 --> 00:04:43,736
and with our skills,

82
00:04:43,787 --> 00:04:46,289
you'll earn more from that 35%

83
00:04:46,323 --> 00:04:48,357
than you ever would
on your own.

84
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,526
Yeah. So you say.

85
00:04:50,544 --> 00:04:52,695
Just wondering why
we're so lucky.

86
00:04:52,713 --> 00:04:54,630
Why cut us in?

87
00:04:54,665 --> 00:04:57,583
Mike is retiring from our crew,

88
00:04:57,634 --> 00:05:00,303
so his share of the partnership
is available,

89
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:03,472
if you can handle his end--

90
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:05,675
distribution.

91
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:07,894
And if you give him
five million dollars

92
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:09,896
of the 15 million
that you brought today.

93
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,081
Just think of it
as a finder's fee

94
00:05:12,115 --> 00:05:14,317
for bringing us together.

95
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:17,954
We have 40 pounds of product
ready to ship,

96
00:05:17,988 --> 00:05:19,689
ready to go.

97
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:22,992
Are you ready?

98
00:05:39,793 --> 00:05:42,411
[Chuckles]

99
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:44,430
Who the hell are ya?

100
00:05:44,464 --> 00:05:46,382
You know.

101
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:50,386
You all know exactly who I am.

102
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,256
Say my name.

103
00:05:55,275 --> 00:05:56,926
Do what? I don't--

104
00:05:56,944 --> 00:05:59,145
I don't have a damn clue
who the hell you are.

105
00:05:59,196 --> 00:06:01,931
Yeah, you do.
I'm the cook.

106
00:06:03,984 --> 00:06:06,602
I'm the man
who killed Gus Fring.

107
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,072
Bullshit.
Cartel got Fring.

108
00:06:10,106 --> 00:06:11,607
Are you sure?

109
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:23,135
That's right.

110
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:27,306
Now... say my name.

111
00:06:32,763 --> 00:06:34,430
Heisenberg.

112
00:06:36,266 --> 00:06:38,601

Hey.

116

I appreciate the kind words,

117
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:25,193
but I'm out too,

118
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:27,195
remember?

119
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:29,563
I know.
We'll talk.

120
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:34,619
Maybe we should talk
about how and when

121
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,904
I'm gonna get
my five million dollars.

122
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:39,040
And we will do that.

123
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:41,376
Absolutely.

124
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,428
It's just, you know--

125
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:46,014
Jesse, just give me
some time here, okay?

126
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,749
I'll need a little help getting things
up and running during this transition.

127
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:50,584
You can at least
do that for me, right?

128
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:55,273
Huh? Come on.
Don't worry.

129
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:57,942
We'll figure it out.
[Door opens]

Well, I guess that's it.

133
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:34,395
Parting thoughts,
of which I have two...

134
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,347
First, as I said,

135
00:08:36,398 --> 00:08:38,399
I'll handle the legacy costs
out of my end

136
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,818
so you won't have to worry
about my guys anymore.

137
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,854
Second, the bug.

138
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:45,990
The DEA will do a sweep.
Can't say when. Could be anytime.

139
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,192
But you need
to get it outta there,

140
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:50,244
sooner rather than later.

141
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:54,332
All right.

142
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:56,317
That's it?

143
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:59,653
No "thanks for
the five million dollars,"

144
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:02,840
no "sorry for chaining you
to a radiator"?

145
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,844
Just get the bug, Walter.

146
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,686
So, hey.

147
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,891
I guess, uh--

148
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:21,976
I guess I'll see you around.

149
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,278
No. Don't think so.

150
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,314
When I'm out, I'm out.

151
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:30,318
Well, I'm out, too, Mike.

152
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,206
Kid...

153
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,708
just look out for yourself.

Okay, Jesse.

You're good.

160

Keep it coming.
Straight back.

161
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:36,434
Slow it down.

162
00:10:36,468 --> 00:10:38,469
All right.
That's good.

00:21:13,153 --> 00:21:16,655
And how soon will you
start using again?

324
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:21,127
Look...

325
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:23,662
Look, I know how upset you are

326
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,331
about what happened
to this boy.

327
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,352
I am just as upset as you are.

328
00:21:29,386 --> 00:21:32,722
Are you? Really?

329
00:21:34,474 --> 00:21:37,509
How can you say that
to me? Jesus!

330
00:21:37,527 --> 00:21:40,146
I mean, I'm the one
who's the father here.

331
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,482
What, do I have to curl up in a
ball in tears in front of you?

332
00:21:43,516 --> 00:21:45,517
Do I have to lock myself
away in a room

333
00:21:45,535 --> 00:21:47,519
and get high
to prove it to you?

334
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:50,072
What happened to that boy
is a tragedy,

335
00:21:50,123 --> 00:21:52,524
and it tears me up inside!

336
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:54,526
But because it happened, what,

337
00:21:54,544 --> 00:21:56,528
am I supposed to just lie down

338
00:21:56,546 --> 00:21:58,530
and die with him?

339
00:21:58,548 --> 00:22:00,082
It's done!

340
00:22:00,133 --> 00:22:02,084
It makes me sick
that it happened,

341
00:22:02,135 --> 00:22:05,037
just like everyone else
who has died in our wake.

342
00:22:05,055 --> 00:22:06,972
What Todd did--

343
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:10,709
You and I have done things
that are just as bad.

344
00:22:10,727 --> 00:22:12,044
Yeah.

345
00:22:12,062 --> 00:22:14,046
All the people
that we've killed--

346
00:22:14,064 --> 00:22:17,266
Gale and the rest...

347
00:22:17,317 --> 00:22:19,268
If you believe
that there's a hell--

348
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:22,271
I don't know if you're into that.
But we're...

349
00:22:22,322 --> 00:22:24,723
We're already pretty much
going there, right?

350
00:22:24,741 --> 00:22:28,244
But I'm not gonna lie down
until I get there.

351
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:32,748
What, just because I don't wanna
cook meth anymore, I'm lying down?

352
00:22:32,783 --> 00:22:35,400
How many more people
are gonna die 'cause of us?

353
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:37,569
No one. None.

354
00:22:37,587 --> 00:22:40,289
Now that we're in control,
no one else gets hurt.

355
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,210
You keep saying that,
and it's bullshit every time!

356
00:22:44,244 --> 00:22:46,712
- No.
- Always! You know what?

357
00:22:46,746 --> 00:22:49,632
I'm done, okay?

358
00:22:49,683 --> 00:22:51,634
You just give me my money,

359
00:22:51,685 --> 00:22:54,136
and you and I--

360
00:22:54,187 --> 00:22:56,439
we're done.

361
00:22:58,892 --> 00:23:02,228
Hmm. Okay.

362
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,730
Why?

363
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:09,401
Why do you want this money?

364
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:14,290
Because it's mine.
It's my cut.

365
00:23:14,324 --> 00:23:17,042
But isn't it filthy
blood money?

366
00:23:17,077 --> 00:23:20,496
I mean, you're so pure.
You have such emotional depth.

367
00:23:20,547 --> 00:23:23,299
No, no, no, no.
You shouldn't touch that dirty money.

368
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,918
I'll save you from that, Jesse.

369
00:23:26,953 --> 00:23:28,587
Come on.

370
00:23:28,621 --> 00:23:30,256
You want it.

371
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,842
You want it just as much
as I want it.

372
00:23:32,893 --> 00:23:35,845
And it's not wrong to want it.

373
00:23:35,896 --> 00:23:37,346
Okay?

374
00:23:37,397 --> 00:23:41,233
So stay and work with me,

375
00:23:41,268 --> 00:23:44,469
and you can make ten ti--
20 times as much.

376
00:23:48,975 --> 00:23:51,744
Whatever, man.

377
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:55,197
You don't wanna pay me,
I don't care.

378
00:23:55,282 --> 00:23:56,699
Yes, you do.

379
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,251
It's on you, all right?

380
00:24:00,287 --> 00:24:02,204
- I'm done.
- No, you're not.

381
00:24:02,255 --> 00:24:04,673
You're not done.
You're not leaving,

382
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,209
because if you leave,
you get nothing!

383
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,796
Do you understand me?
Nothing!

384
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,299
Jesse!

385
00:24:18,018 --> 00:24:20,553
<i>Budget for the current fiscal
year for electronic surveillance</i>

386
00:24:20,587 --> 00:24:21,854

387
00:24:21,888 --> 00:24:24,490
<i>on par with ATF</i>
<i>and the Marshal Service,</i>

388
00:24:24,524 --> 00:24:26,959
<i>but still just a fraction</i>
<i>of FBI totals.</i>

389
00:24:26,993 --> 00:24:30,045
<i>We're lobbying congress</i>
<i>for an additional 1.41,</i>

390
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:32,181

394

395
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:45,344

00:24:47,847 --> 00:24:49,565
<i>Hank?</i>

398
00:24:49,616 --> 00:24:51,367
<i>Hank!</i>

399
00:24:52,786 --> 00:24:55,237
<i>I think we're going</i>

402
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,410
<i>Thank you, everybody.</i>

403
00:25:14,341 --> 00:25:16,225
<i>You know no one wants</i>

404
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:18,394
<i>to see you succeed at this</i>
<i>more than me, right?</i>

405
00:25:18,428 --> 00:25:21,096
- Yes, sir.
<i>- I know how good you are.</i>

406
00:25:21,147 --> 00:25:24,233
<i>I wouldn't have stuck my neck out
to get you here if I didn't.</i>

407
00:25:24,267 --> 00:25:26,602
<i>But you're not knocking</i>

408
00:25:26,653 --> 00:25:28,771
<i>You're in charge</i>

409
00:25:28,822 --> 00:25:30,990
<i>and that comes</i>
<i>with responsibilities.</i>

410
00:25:31,024 --> 00:25:33,192
<i>I mean, Hank, basic reports</i>

411
00:25:33,226 --> 00:25:35,494
<i>aren't being filed</i>
<i>in a timely manner.</i>

412
00:25:35,528 --> 00:25:37,413
I'll work on it.
It'll get better.

413
00:25:37,447 --> 00:25:39,832
<i>Yeah, it will, because way
too much time and money</i>

414
00:25:39,866 --> 00:25:41,533
<i>is being spent</i>
<i>on the Fring case,</i>

415
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:43,202
<i>a case which is</i>
<i>essentially over.</i>

416
00:25:43,236 --> 00:25:45,087
<i>All this overtime</i>

417
00:25:45,121 --> 00:25:47,373
<i>to surveil Michael Ehrmantraut?</i>

418
00:25:47,407 --> 00:25:49,408
<i>That's just money that could</i>
<i>be better spent elsewhere.</i>

419
00:25:49,426 --> 00:25:51,093
I understand,

420
00:25:51,127 --> 00:25:52,911
but I'm not making
these choices lightly.

421
00:25:52,929 --> 00:25:55,414
We've got increased reports
of blue meth on the street,

422
00:25:55,432 --> 00:25:58,250
Fring's gang is still operational,
and Ehrmantraut is involved.

423
00:25:58,268 --> 00:25:59,584
It's that simple.

424
00:25:59,603 --> 00:26:01,586
<i>I believe you.</i>
<i>But so what?</i>

425
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:03,588
<i>It's one case out of dozens,</i>

426
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:06,558
<i>and you don't play favorites with it
just because it used to be yours.</i>

427
00:26:06,592 --> 00:26:08,560
- I really think that--
<i>- Don't play favorites with it, Hank.</i>

428
00:26:08,594 --> 00:26:10,429
<i>You got a bigger job than that.</i>

429
00:26:10,447 --> 00:26:12,431
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>forget the financial cost.</i>

430
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:14,933
<i>I hear you're personally serving
search warrants out in the field?</i>

431
00:26:14,951 --> 00:26:17,236
That was an error in judgment.

432
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,288
- Won't happen again.
<i>- You're damn right it won't.</i>

433
00:26:19,322 --> 00:26:21,290
<i>I'm just gonna bottom line</i>
<i>this for you.</i>

434
00:26:21,324 --> 00:26:24,326
<i>The surveillance budget</i>
<i>for Ehrmantraut is now zero.</i>

435
00:26:24,377 --> 00:26:26,412
<i>We clear?</i>

436
00:26:26,446 --> 00:26:29,298
Sure. Thank you.

437
00:26:29,332 --> 00:26:31,350
- Clear.
<i>- Good.</i>

438
00:26:31,384 --> 00:26:33,385
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

439
00:26:42,846 --> 00:26:45,514
[Knocking] Yeah?

440
00:26:46,966 --> 00:26:48,633
Hey.

441
00:26:54,474 --> 00:26:57,242
So, Ramey wanted
to catch up with you?

442
00:26:57,277 --> 00:26:59,161
Talk sports and stuff, I guess?

443
00:26:59,195 --> 00:27:01,113
Yeah.
Something like that.

444
00:27:01,147 --> 00:27:04,033
No more following Ehrmantraut.

445
00:27:04,084 --> 00:27:07,619
Not worth
the financial investment.

446
00:27:07,653 --> 00:27:09,838
Well, it's not like
the guy's going anywhere.

447
00:27:09,873 --> 00:27:12,324
He's not even bothering
to throw our tails anymore.

448
00:27:12,342 --> 00:27:14,343
He's just living
a boring old-man life

449
00:27:14,377 --> 00:27:16,929
like he has nothing left
to hide.

450
00:27:16,963 --> 00:27:18,964
And none of Fring's crew
is talking?

451
00:27:18,998 --> 00:27:20,632
Not giving an inch.

452
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:22,718
You sweeten the pot enough?

453
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:26,021
Zero jail time and an
all-expense-paid trip to Maui?

454
00:27:26,056 --> 00:27:28,173
[Chuckles] Not that, but close.

455
00:27:28,191 --> 00:27:29,841
Nobody wants to bite.

456
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:31,176
Christ!

457
00:27:31,194 --> 00:27:33,278
They're either the most
loyal crew in history,

458
00:27:33,313 --> 00:27:34,947
or someone's
still paying them off.

459
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:36,281
You still checking
bank records?

460
00:27:36,316 --> 00:27:37,700
No one living
beyond their means.

461
00:27:37,734 --> 00:27:39,651
Nine perps...

462
00:27:39,685 --> 00:27:41,904
All being represented
by one lawyer.

463
00:27:41,955 --> 00:27:44,189
Not unusual
in a case like this.

464
00:27:44,207 --> 00:27:46,191
Yeah, this guy--
What's his name?

465
00:27:46,209 --> 00:27:49,078
Daniel Wachsberger?

466
00:27:49,129 --> 00:27:52,214
He represents every one
of these douchebags

467
00:27:52,248 --> 00:27:54,533
except for Ehrmantraut.

468
00:27:54,551 --> 00:27:56,868
Can we find out
more about the lawyer?

469
00:27:56,886 --> 00:27:59,138
You want me to start
tailing a lawyer?

470
00:27:59,172 --> 00:28:01,724
Like the shit ain't deep
enough for you already?

471
00:28:01,758 --> 00:28:03,726
Hey, Ramey said we couldn't
follow Ehrmantraut.

472
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,228
He didn't say anything
about anybody else.

473
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,713
Do it.

474
00:28:08,732 --> 00:28:11,233
You're the boss.

475
00:28:14,237 --> 00:28:15,571
[Door closes]

476
00:28:18,491 --> 00:28:20,392
[Sighs]

477
00:28:31,204 --> 00:28:32,871
[Sighs]

478

But, uh, did you take
chemistry in high school?

No.

Okay.
That's all right.

485
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,612
As we go, I'll be as
detailed as possible

00:28:56,646 --> 00:28:58,781

is your full effort
and attention.

Listen and apply yourself.

493

If you do that,
then we just might have

494
00:29:18,618 --> 00:29:21,119
a fighting chance here, okay?

495
00:29:24,123 --> 00:29:26,625

00:40:05,718 --> 00:40:07,435
I can't get close.

638
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,504
I need you to pick up that bag

639
00:40:09,522 --> 00:40:11,640
and get it to me
as soon as possible.

640
00:40:11,674 --> 00:40:14,476
Do you know how thick the crap storm
is out there because of this?

641
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,645
I told you not to use that lawyer.
He's a hack!

642
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:19,281
- Shut up, Saul, and get the bag.
<i>[Jesse] - Hey, Mike,</i>

643
00:40:19,315 --> 00:40:20,816
I can get it to you, all right?

644
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,685
- Just tell me what to do.
<i>- No, kid. Not you.</i>

645
00:40:23,703 --> 00:40:26,955
I'm paying Saul.
He can do the job just fine.

646
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:29,658
Yeah, you're paying me,
and the DEA knows I represent you,

647
00:40:29,692 --> 00:40:31,660
so they're probably
sitting on my car right now,

648
00:40:31,694 --> 00:40:33,712
hoping I do something stupid.

649
00:40:33,746 --> 00:40:35,864
Mike, I can do it, okay?
It's not a problem.

650
00:40:35,882 --> 00:40:36,882
No, Jesse.

651
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:38,216
Jesus, I'll do it.

652
00:40:38,251 --> 00:40:40,836
Besides, you're out, remember?

653
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,871
Mike, tell me where
to get this bag.

657
00:41:56,612 --> 00:41:58,847
Hello, Walter.

658
00:42:00,516 --> 00:42:02,751
Before I hand this over,

659
00:42:02,785 --> 00:42:04,286
I need something from you.

660
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,687
And what's that?

661
00:42:05,721 --> 00:42:07,923
The names of your nine men.

662
00:42:07,957 --> 00:42:10,725
[Scoffs] Why?

663
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,261
You're never gonna pay them off.
What's the point?

664
00:42:13,295 --> 00:42:16,514
The point is, Mike,
it affects me.

665
00:42:16,565 --> 00:42:20,101
It affects Jesse, too,
and we deserve to know.

666
00:42:20,135 --> 00:42:23,104
The only thing left
to do now is leave town.

667
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:24,606
You understand?

668
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,808
"Leave town." Wow.

669
00:42:26,842 --> 00:42:30,645
Yeah, I just can't up and
leave, like you, Mike.

670
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,148
I've got a family.
I've got people who depend on me.

671
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:36,117
Yeah.

672
00:42:51,267 --> 00:42:53,601
Good-bye, Walter.

673
00:42:55,671 --> 00:42:58,373
You're welcome!

674
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:02,143
[Scoffs]

675
00:43:02,178 --> 00:43:04,145
I'm sorry, what?

676
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,698
I want those names, Mike.
You owe me that much.

677
00:43:06,732 --> 00:43:08,700
I don't owe you a damn thing.

678
00:43:08,734 --> 00:43:12,520
All of this, falling apart
like this, is on you.

679
00:43:12,538 --> 00:43:14,022
Wow.

680
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,957
[Laughs] Wow!

681
00:43:15,992 --> 00:43:19,044
Oh, that's some kind of logic
right there, Mike.

682
00:43:19,078 --> 00:43:22,247
You screw up, get yourself
followed by the DEA,

683
00:43:22,298 --> 00:43:24,582
and now, suddenly,
this is all my fault?

684
00:43:24,633 --> 00:43:26,251
Why don't you walk me
through this, Mike?

685
00:43:26,302 --> 00:43:29,304
We had a good thing,
you stupid son of a bitch!

686
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:31,756
We had Fring.
We had a lab.

687
00:43:31,807 --> 00:43:34,676
We had everything we needed,
and it all ran like clockwork.

688
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,678
- Oh, my God.
- You could've shut your mouth,

689
00:43:36,712 --> 00:43:39,931
cooked, and made as much
money as you ever needed.

690
00:43:39,982 --> 00:43:43,551
It was perfect.
But, no, you just had to blow it up.

691
00:43:43,569 --> 00:43:46,220
You and your pride
and your ego!

692
00:43:46,238 --> 00:43:48,523
You just had to be the man.

693
00:43:48,557 --> 00:43:51,192
If you'd done your job,
known your place,

694
00:43:51,226 --> 00:43:53,411
we'd all be fine right now!

I just realized
that Lydia has the names.

701
00:46:12,168 --> 00:46:14,419
I can get them from her.

702
00:46:19,091 --> 00:46:21,142
I'm sorry, Mike.

703
00:46:22,678 --> 00:46:26,014
This-- this whole thing
could've been avoided--

704
00:46:26,048 --> 00:46:28,566
Shut the fuck up.
